The domestic box office, which regularly exceeded $10 billion in annual ticket sales before COVID-19, is expected to reach only $8.5 billion this year. \n\nFilms now average 32 days in theaters compared to 80 days pre-pandemic, limiting opportunities for audiences to discover movies spontaneously. Midtier films generating $50-100 million at the box office have become scarcer, particularly in genres like drama and romantic comedy. Theater chains are responding with enhanced experiences and loyalty programs to draw audiences back. \n\n\"It's fair to say there is a missing billion dollars that, if we had the right movies, people would be going to see them,\" said Bruce Nash, founder of movie business site the Numbers, told LA Times. Frequent moviegoers comprise only 12-15% of box office revenue, according to Patrick Corcoran of theater consulting firm Fithian Group.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=The+Casual+Moviegoer+is+a+Thing+of+the+Past%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fentertainment.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F02%2F200207%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fentertainment.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F02%2F200207%2Fthe-casual-moviegoer-is-a-thing-of-the-past%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/24/12/02/200207/the-casual-moviegoer-is-a-thing-of-the-past?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23539343&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

Promising salaries of over $800 per month -- double the average pay for chemists in Mexican companies, along with potential bonuses like cars or housing -- recruiters capitalize on the financial struggles of young professionals. \n\nThese \"cooks\" are tasked with improving fentanyl's addictive quality and finding alternative synthesis methods to mitigate supply chain disruptions caused by stricter chemical export controls from China and pandemic-induced bottlenecks. The Times interviewed seven drug \"cooks,\" three university chemistry students recruited by the Sinaloa cartel, two agents, a recruiter, and a university professor -- all anonymously to avoid cartel retaliation. According to the recruiter, candidates must be passionate, discreet, and indifferent to the ethical consequences of their work. The university professor highlighted a disturbing trend: students openly expressed interest in synthesizing illicit drugs during lectures.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Mexican+Cartels+Lure+Chemistry+Students+To+Make+Fentanyl%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F02%2F2336239%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F02%2F2336239%2Fmexican-cartels-lure-chemistry-students-to-make-fentanyl%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://yro.slashdot.org/story/24/12/02/2336239/mexican-cartels-lure-chemistry-students-to-make-fentanyl?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23539531&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

      "content": "India has struck a landmark $715 million deal with 30 global academic publishers to provide nationwide free access to nearly 13,000 research journals. The \"One Nation One Subscription\" initiative, launching January 2025, will benefit an estimated 18 million students and researchers. The agreement, which surpasses similar arrangements in Germany and the UK, marks a significant shift in India's academic publishing landscape, despite the country's position as the world's third-largest producer of research papers. Science magazine: India's is expected to encompass some 6300 government-funded institutions, which produce almost half the country's research papers. Currently, only about 2300 of these institutions have subscriptions to 8000 journals. Under the new arrangement, \"universities that aren't so well funded, and can't afford many journals, will gain,\" said Aniket Sule of the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education. Specialist institutes that only subscribe to journals relevant to their field will benefit from accessing work outside their silos, he added. Colleges that want to subscribe to journals not included under this initiative can use their own funds to do so. \n\nSome part of the $715 million will cover the fees some journals charge to publish papers open access, making them immediately free to read by anyone worldwide when published, Madalli told Science. Details of that component have not been worked out yet, but the amount will be calculated based on the country's current spending on these fees, known as article-processing charges (APCs), which are paid by authors or their institutions, Madalli says.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=India+Takes+Out+Giant+Nationwide+Subscription+To+13%2C000+Journals%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F03%2F0220227%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F03%2F0220227%2Findia-takes-out-giant-nationwide-subscription-to-13000-journals%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://science.slashdot.org/story/24/12/03/0220227/india-takes-out-giant-nationwide-subscription-to-13000-journals?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23539681&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

      "content": "<p>\\\nThis year’s Devcon in Southeast Asia was a huge success. It hosted <strong>12,500 attendees from 130 countries</strong>, 60% of whom were first-time attendees, including me. The Devcon week was full of great meetings, insights, and impressions of busy and authentic Bangkok.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/6QzmwdnBzQgN4B1y6LieCT8zOfV2-bf23ebk.jpeg\" alt=\"I love the brand identity of Devcon. It was tailored to the Thai visual system.\" title=\"left-50\" /></p>\n<p>My name is <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DariaStrategy\">Daria</a>.</strong> I’m the Head of Marketing at <strong>ETHWarsaw</strong> (the conference and hackathon) and a content creator focusing on the product and culture sides of the web3 field.</p>\n<p>\\\nI have attended EthCC, Devconnect, Dappcon, ZK Summit, ETHDam, ETHWarsaw, and ETHBucharest (some of these events I attended several times) and many other community and niche events. I have also participated in a few hackathons as a hacker and mentor, but Devcon in Bangkok exceeded expectations!</p>\n<p>\\\nIn this article, I share my impressions and experience about Devcon 7, the hottest trends of the blockchain and crypto industry, and explain why I like the Ethereum community so much.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis event will probably become part of the history of the decentralized internet and may start a new crypto bull run. By the way, what are the current prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum? 😉</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"thepeopleandvibesofethereum\">The People and Vibes of Ethereum</h2>\n<p>Despite the high cost of transactions and the scaling challenges, no other blockchain ecosystem has such a level of adoption among mass users as Ethereum. L2 networks, Account Abstraction technology, staking and restaking, and many other projects aim to bypass technical limitations and make Ethereum the most usable blockchain.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>The openness to project creation and support for innovation from the Ethereum Foundation create the conditions for developing a unique community.</strong> In this community, there is a place for founders, developers and engineers, marketers and designers, and everyone who has a hand in accelerating the transition of the Internet to its decentralized stage, where the ownership of content belongs to the creator and finances or personal data do not depend on centralized entities.</p>\n<p>\\\nCompared to traditional industries, I feel more freedom and openness in web3 (especially in the Ethereum community). People are more authentic and less corporate. <strong>Aggressive sales and transactional relations look toxic.</strong> There is more desire to contribute to be valuable and well-known. Of course, <strong><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/web3-hiring-culture-what-can-we-improve\">as I described in my previous article</a></strong>, there are many hiring and corporate culture challenges. Still, they are not as critical as the discoveries, innovations, and opportunities this field offers.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe day before Devcon, my husband and I met one of the most influential Ethereum content creators — <strong>sassal.eth</strong>, the host of <strong>The Daily Gwei.</strong> This guy can talk about Ethereum for hours, and I'm super happy that our visions for the ecosystem are aligned. It was a great start to a long and exciting week!</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/6QzmwdnBzQgN4B1y6LieCT8zOfV2-ee33dms.jpeg\" alt=\"Me, sassal.eth, and my husband Andrii at the Devcon venue, Day 0\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Vitalik Buterin</strong>, the co-inventor of Ethereum, is hugely famous, but not many people know his father. Meeting <strong>Dima Buterin</strong> at the venue was a pleasant surprise. He is a great person who can inspire and be an example to many beyond the Ethereum ecosystem. As a Ukrainian, I’m thankful to Dima for his support and contribution to the Ukrainian blockchain ecosystem during these tough times.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/6QzmwdnBzQgN4B1y6LieCT8zOfV2-4413dmt.jpeg\" alt=\"My husband Andrii and I with Dima Buterin, Vitalik's father\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nI was happy to meet <strong>Austin Griffith,</strong> the co-founder of <strong>BuidlGuidl</strong> and a legend among Ethereum builders. I invited him to speak and inspire newbie devs at the ETHWarsaw conference next year.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/6QzmwdnBzQgN4B1y6LieCT8zOfV2-tg23d1a.jpeg\" alt=\"Austin Griffith from BuidlGuidl and I at the main Devcon venue\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThe overall experience of blockchain week in Thailand was positive. I constantly felt FOMO because I wanted to attend all the events that interested me, and the traffic in Bangkok was sometimes problematic. Nevertheless, I will share the most exciting topics of this year's event below, which will 100% affect the future of decentralized systems and interpersonal connections on the internet.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"theweb3trendsandhottesttopics\">The Web3 trends and hottest topics</h2>\n<p>If you missed Devcon 7, you can watch all the talks and workshops on the Ethereum Foundation <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@EthereumFoundation/videos\">YouTube channel</a>.</strong> There are more than 300 hours of high-end technical, conceptual and culture-oriented content about the future of blockchain and crypto. However, I can highlight the most discussable topics that reflect the market situation and trends.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"aiagents\">🤖 AI Agents</h3>\n<p>If you go to any web3 hackathon now, you can definitely find at least 3-5 projects focused on creating AI agents for different use cases.</p>\n<p>\\\nAI agents in the web3 sphere are autonomous software entities that combine&nbsp;AI&nbsp;and&nbsp;decentralized technologies&nbsp;to perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with decentralized networks or smart contracts. AI agents can enable new ways of monetizing data, creativity, and services within decentralized ecosystems.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"tokenizationandrwa\">🪙 Tokenization and RWA</h3>\n<p>“Tokenize whatever!“ - this is the slogan for some projects in web3. Sometimes, it looks unnecessary, but there are many cases when tokenization helps to scale existing business models and turn them into more innovative and usable ones — for instance, Real-World Assets or RWA.</p>\n<p>\\\nRWAs are tangible or traditional financial assets — such as real estate, commodities, equities, or bonds — that have been tokenized to exist on a blockchain. Tokenization involves creating digital tokens representing ownership or rights to these physical assets, enabling them to be managed and traded within DeFi platforms.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"lackofconsumerorientedapplicationsandpoorux\">⛔️ Lack of consumer-oriented applications and poor UX</h3>\n<p>The industry has too many L2 networks and other infrastructure projects, but only a few products exist for users. We are still too far from seeing our neighbors using DeFi apps or decentralized privacy solutions. Infrastructure projects can raise more money, so many founders decided to focus on tech more than on consumers. That’s why many projects are built without the expertise of UX designers - by developers who design solutions for tech-savvy individuals.</p>\n<p>\\\nMy husband Andrii, the product designer for Web3 products, conducted a workshop at Devcon on user research and customer journey mapping. I was surprised by how many people weren’t aware of these “golden classic” methods from the web2 world. If you are interested in learning users in web3, here is the link to the video recording of his workshop.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"accountabstraction\">📲 Account Abstraction</h3>\n<p>This technology can help overcome the barriers of onboarding consumers to web3 by reducing gas costs for users with Paymaster, supporting social recovery (your family members or friends can be your wallet guardians), enhancing control over funds and operational workflows for institutional entities, and much more.</p>\n<p>\\\nAA technology is vital to the Ethereum Foundation. The organizers created a dedicated room - Account Abstraction Hub - to discuss the topics related to smart account wallets, increased security, and web3 user onboarding. You can read <strong><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/account-abstraction-helps-web3-founders-create-brands-users-love\">my article about Account Abstraction</a></strong> and how it helps web3 founders create exciting user and brand experiences.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"memecoins\">🤡 Memecoins</h3>\n<p>The new era of memecoins has come. Whether you like them or not, this huge trend will only grow.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/6QzmwdnBzQgN4B1y6LieCT8zOfV2-ks23dry.jpeg\" alt=\"https://thedefiant.io/news/tokens/clanker-gives-rise-to-ai-memecoin-boom-on-base\" title=\"left-50\" /></p>\n<p>The success of Pumpfun (the platform for memecoins built on Solana) has boosted the high interest in memecoins to the moon in all possible blockchain ecosystems. They are cheaper and fast-growing alternatives to traditional crypto coins and can be created by anyone. Memecoins like DODGE and SHIBA are now OGs.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe recent Clanker AI agent creates tokens in response to text-based instructions from Farcaster users. According to The Defiant, on Nov. 26, the fees generated by Clanker, an AI agent built to launch tokens on Base in response to text-based prompts, tagged an all-time high of $1.2 million, according to Dune. Since launching on Nov. 8, the project has accumulated $7.1 million worth of fees.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"blockchainforpublicgood\">🌎 Blockchain for Public Good</h3>\n<p>The current state of social, economic, political and military aspects in the world sucks, to say the least. Innovations in decentralized technologies can partially overcome some social and economic problems relevant to most people on Earth, such as lack of savings (financial safety “bag”), lack of access to stock markets and the ability to invest in stocks, trading personal data by centralized social networks like Facebook or TikTok, lack of ownership of content published by the author on the Internet, and many others.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Stani Kulechov</strong> from <strong>Avara</strong> described how he believes we should use blockchain and crypto's potential for the public good.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/6QzmwdnBzQgN4B1y6LieCT8zOfV2-6433eb3.jpeg\" alt=\"The founder of the Avara company (Aave, Lens) about the power of decentralization for innovations and economic growth\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"devrelasaformatofb2dmarketing\">🧑‍💻 DevRel as a format of B2D marketing</h3>\n<p>Many infra projects hire developer relations specialists to share the value of their technology with developers; this format can be called Business-To-Developers.</p>\n<p>\\\nDevRel engages with developers through events, forums, and online platforms to foster a thriving community. They also create learning resources, such as documentation, tutorials, and webinars, to teach developers how to use the company's products effectively. Effective DevRels not only empower developers but also align closely with the company's product, marketing, and support functions to achieve overall success.</p>\n<p>\\\nRecently, I finished my studies at the DevRel Uni course led by Bianca Buzea from Chronicle Protocol. I spent six insightful weeks with the great DevRel engineers. In this photo, Bianca, my coursemate Szutung and I are at the Devcon venue.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/6QzmwdnBzQgN4B1y6LieCT8zOfV2-t413dt2.jpeg\" alt=\"Szutung, Bianca and I, after Bianca's talk about the developer experience \" /></p>\n<p>\\\nAt the <strong>SheFi Summit</strong>, I met <strong>Matt Hamilton,</strong> the <strong>Arbitrum Foundation's</strong> DevRel engineer. We discussed some DevRel stuff and even recorded a short video about <a href=\"https://x.com/HammerToe/status/1856019068223938996\">my students' experience during the DevRel course</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/6QzmwdnBzQgN4B1y6LieCT8zOfV2-ok23dxy.jpeg\" alt=\"Matt and I at the SheFi Summit\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n\\\nThe <strong>ETHGlobal hackathon</strong> team shares the main themes for builders’ projects.

We all know these crazy club hangouts for crypto bros with lots of booze and questionable entertainment. I’m strongly against this and call everyone organizing such parties to stop.</p>\n<p>\\\nHowever, if well-organized and with good intentions, they are a great way to relax after complex technical presentations and workshops. I believe such interactions, which create new quality connections, have a right to exist.</p>\n<p>\\\nI was happy to participate in the ZK Sante event, which was organized by the projects from the <strong>ZKsync</strong> community. The teams of <strong>Clave, txFusion, Zyfi</strong> and <strong>Venus Protocol</strong> gathered friends and business partners for quality network and to celebrate the successful conference. In the photo, you can see me and the team members of the mentioned projects at a rooftop bar.</p>\n<p>\\\nI was also invited to the event organized by <strong>Base/Coinbase</strong> under the slogan “The Future is Based.” It was a gathering for Base's friends and ecosystem partners in one of Bangkok's most conceptual bars. It was a pleasure to learn more about this blockchain and meet people who are developing one of the most successful ecosystems!</p>\n<p>\\\nI met a few founders of the projects built on Base there and had an insightful chat with <strong>Will, a core team member and contributor to Base.</strong></p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/6QzmwdnBzQgN4B1y6LieCT8zOfV2-pb63d94.jpeg\" alt=\"Happy and inspired by great conversation with Will\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nI believe that such evening events work very well for building a quality network and an opportunity to meet in an informal setting with those who inspire you or with those for whom you are an example ✨</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusions\">Conclusions</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/6QzmwdnBzQgN4B1y6LieCT8zOfV2-bg83dej.jpeg\" alt=\"Thai tea is everywhere! In hot or cold formats, it tastes fantastic ;)\" title=\"left-50\" /></p>\n<p>Devcon 7 in Bangkok was the place to be if you work in blockchain and crypto. The <strong>800+ side events</strong> (just imagine these numbers!)<strong>,</strong> in addition to the main event, reflected an incredibly high interest in web3 tech and career opportunities in the sphere. People who attended previous Devcons say this one was the best so far, and I don’t have any reasons for doubt.</p>\n<p>\\\nI was happy to participate in such a huge blockchain event, where great minds and enthusiasts from different countries gathered in one place to ideate, discuss, build, and share experiences. It was amazing to reconnect with some of my old friends and meet new ones.</p>\n<p>\\\nI realized how bullish I am about DevRel and everything related to the product and tech sides compared to traditional marketing. I love discussing tech concepts and pieces of research and how they impact individuals and global societies.</p>\n<p>\\\nI like Bangkok's vibrant mix of old and new. It illustrates fast-developing economies. I'm sure Devcon positively impacted the Thai economic system. Taylor Swift has influenced regional economies in different parts of the world with her shows, and Devcon was influential in tech and social development.</p>\n<p>\\\nMy Thailand experience was also good overall despite the long flight (6 + 6 hours) from Europe. It was my first time in Asia, and probably not the last.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>:::info\nRead my previous articles about <strong><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/zero-knowledge-hackathon-insights-and-recommendations\">Zero-Knowledge Hackathon Insights and Recommendations</a><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/launching-a-web3-project-in-2023-my-go-to-market-strategy-part-2?ref=hackernoon.com\">,</a></strong>&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/account-abstraction-helps-web3-founders-create-brands-users-love\">Account Abstraction for Better Web3 User and Brand Experience</a></strong>, and the&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/web3-hiring-culture-what-can-we-improve?ref=hackernoon.com\">challenges of the Web3 hiring culture.</a></strong></p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\\nFollow me on social media:&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dariastrategy?ref=hackernoon.com\">LinkedIn</a></strong>,&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DariaStrategy?ref=hackernoon.com\">X</a></strong>, and&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@dariastrategy?ref=hackernoon.com\">YouTube</a>.</strong></p>",

      "content": "<p>\\\nFor the European Union 2024 is de facto the first year that MiCA regulations are implemented. This process is long, and it may be compared with a train driving inside the tunnel. And now he's in the middle…</p>\n<p>\\\nOn the one hand with the implementation of MiCA the European Union has the most sustainable regulatory system, which regulates cryptoassets in 27 European countries and this legislation is all harmonised on the whole EU territory. At the same time, MiCA creates new challenges for users and blockchain companies.</p>\n<p>\\n <strong>Issue 1. Obstructing Access to Stablecoins</strong></p>\n<p>An important element of MiCA is the compulsory licensing of stablecoins, which protects the rights of users and investors. The purpose here is to prevent the risk of stablecoins depeg, like in 2022 with UST. MiCA spells out the requirement for stablecoin reserves - 1:1. Moreover, stablecoin issues should keep from 30% up to 60% of these reserves on bank deposits.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis requirement has unexpectedly created many problems for issuers of stablecoins who operate in the European Union and thus for users within the EU. Tether, issuer of USDT and EURT rejected to get license in the EU. Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino this August has explained its position in <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Fl3rP7jgAc&t=499s\">interview</a></strong> to Cointelegraph amid the delisting of USDT from European exchanges and circulating rumors about the company's issues.</p>\n<p>\\\nArdoino noted that MiCA requirements for stablecoins cause a \"systemic risk”. He considered the EU requirement to hold up to 60% of stablecoin reserves in local banks dangerous, citing the bankruptcy of Silicon Valley Bank, which caused USDC to depeg, as an example of the risk involved. In the EU, this risk is amplified since banks only guarantee deposits of up to €100,000 - a ridiculously low figure for Tether's reserves. By the way, other issuers, such as Circle, also recognize the problems with regulating stablecoins in EU regarding reserve requirements.</p>\n<p>\\\nAlmost four months have passed since Ardoino's interview, but the parties' positions have not changed. In the end, Tether announced that the EURt stablecoin will end exactly one year later - on 25 November 2025. However, Tether still will have some projects in the EU: stablecoins EURq and USDq issued by Dutch Company Quantoz Payments.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf MiCA requirements led to the development of the European stablecoin market, making it more difficult for foreign issuers to access it, it would be understandable. However, the market for euro-linked stablecoins is in its infancy, as evidenced by their marketcap: EURS (124 mln), EURC (84 mln), EURCV (33 mln), EURt (36 mln). The total emission of the biggest EUR backed stablecoins is hundreds of times less than dollar pegged USDT (133 bln) and USDC (39 bln). Such a small circulating supply is clearly insufficient even for the European crypto market and exchanges, not to mention international settlements in EUR coins.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf users are restricted in their ability to conduct transactions in dollar-denominated stablecoins, such as trading, and no popular euro-denominated stablecoins become available, their interests will suffer. In addition, this could force users to use USDT illegally and everyone would lose out. Stablecoins are just one example of the shortcomings of MiCA requirements, where I think European regulators should think about improving. But there are other areas as well.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"issue2vasptransitiontocasps\">Issue 2: VASP Transition to CASPs</h3>\n<p>Requirements for crypto entities in the EU are getting stricter under MiCA. Registered VASPs are obligated to get CASP (Crypto Asset Service Provider) license. Apart from the name change, this implies stricter licensing and auditing procedures - more restrictions and costs. CASPs license holders should establish a real presence in the jurisdiction, such as real director, AML officer, real office and some others. Not all of these requirements are yet known and understood, so how difficult they are for businesses will be known by mid-2025, when re-registration will be in full swing.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe picture below shows how many months different EU countries give for this transition.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/sBGdF0DbxXNwhS0pFRPmgiVVOt32-2024-12-03T04:56:18.539Z-j7ojjrvw0434ukoc2em2n72m\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nPoland, Netherlands, and Lithuania gave companies only half a year. Probably such small terms for Poland and Lithuania are caused by too many operating crypto entities in these countries and the desire of the EU to introduce stricter control over VASP there. Probably the number of licenses in Lithuania and Poland will decrease significantly. And it is through these countries that many startups and blockchain companies operate and some of them may likely consider switching jurisdictions, especially if we are talking about startups that have been testing their business model in the EU to enter the US and Asian markets.</p>\n<p>\\\n​​But it's not all bad, other popular jurisdictions for VASP registration have tried to give businesses more time to comply with the new requirements. France, Luxembourg, Malta, Estonia, Czech Republic and Cyprus (it is not in the table) have a long transition period for VASPs - 18-19 months.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"issue3stifleinnovationsandlosingleadership\">Issue 3: Stifle Innovations and Losing Leadership</h3>\n<p>The European Union in recent years has been exactly the fintech sandbox, the field of innovation where international crypto companies could test their business models and services, due to liberal legislation and transparent game rules.</p>\n<p>\\\nSome critics fear that Europe will cease to be a global crypto hub after the introduction of MiCA. Whether these fears are justified or not is still being determined too. But indeed, growing regulatory requirements may encourage some startups to choose other markets to test their product. It all depends on the decisions of regulators - what will be the climate for business and convenience for ordinary users.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhile Europe is tightening regulation, some countries such as the US, on the contrary, are planning to liberalize their approach to crypto regulation. After the US Presidential Elections, the crypto market is booming for the whole of November.</p>\n<h3 id=\"micabenefitsinvestorprotectionandtransparency\">MiCA Benefits: Investor Protection and Transparency</h3>\n<p>On the other hand let's talk about the advantages of MiCA is the protection of crypto investors' rights indeed in 2017 during ICO boom crypto companies abused EU facilities, registered in countries such as Estonia and were engaged in dubious operations. Total number of companies operating from Estonia was quite large (up to 4000). For this reason MiCA increasing compliance requirement looks justified to prevent such cases.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis also applies to AML. Here MiCA introduces a clear travel rule. Crypto companies should report any transactions over 1000 euros. Although in the US this amount is $10,000, the MiCA requirements are indeed better from an anti-money laundering point of view. So by MiCA implementation, investors are given certain rights and cryptocurrency users can to get greater transparency from crypto businesses. Nevertheless, in this case the balance of interests of business and investors is important. And certainly in the case where regulation may look restrictive in that part.</p>\n<h3 id=\"operationsinalleujurisdictions\">Operations in all EU jurisdictions</h3>\n<p>MiCA aims to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto-assets, significantly simplifying the licensing process for projects operating within the EU. Previously, acquiring the necessary licenses was a challenging task, as companies had to navigate a patchwork of complex rules across different member states. Under MiCA, the need for multiple licenses is greatly reduced, replaced by a single harmonized set of regulations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sodoesmicareallyneedimprovement\">So does MiCA Really Need Improvement?</h3>\n<p>It is worth considering there is a need for some changes or additions to MiCAR. I'm talking about, for instance, requirements for stablecoins - if popular issuers such as Tether will not be available to operate in Europe, ordinary crypto traders and investors will suffer, whose interests the regulators care so much about.&nbsp; Yes, the interests of users should have been the top priority, but so that they are not taken care of as well as the fintech sector in the country.</p>\n<p>\\\nSo regulators need to strike a balance, partly. This is already happening, for example, the vast majority of the European Union countries more than half of them gave a transitional period for VASPs of a year to adapt to the changes.&nbsp;Despite all MiCA issues, there is a chance that business and regulators will come to a realisation next year, that regulation needs to be improved. It may just take longer to reach agreement among all EU member states. At the local level, there have already been some advances: Romania exempted cryptocurrency proceeds from taxes in November.</p>\n<p>\\\nNevertheless, the expressed fears may not be justified - it will not be possible to talk about how the MiCA has actually affected businesses and users of cryptocurrencies in the European Union until the end of 2025.&nbsp; If you are interested in getting more crypto regulation insights, you can watch the global crypto regulation rating&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cryptopenetration.com/?ref=hackernoon.com\">here</a>&nbsp;and get updates on my&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/crypto%5Fpen%5Fon?ref=hackernoon.com\">X account</a>.</p>",

A traditional product manager is responsible for overseeing the entire product lifecycle, from concept to market launch, by defining the product strategy, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and ensuring the final product meets customer needs, with a focus on building core features and functionality to address user pain points while aligning with long-term market goals; essentially acting as the central point of contact for all product-related decisions throughout development. After the Agile revolution in the early 2000’s the product manager role is split into various sub roles such as:</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/7WUnLqswtST7p9EJKcWdJr6eFlz1-2024-12-03T05:06:10.252Z-s5wwif67ufbnpbadamj3h9nb\" alt=\"Types of Product Managers (source: Education Edge)\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Types of Roles:</strong></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Technical:</strong> They are highly involved in the product’s technical aspects, ensuring that the development team understands and meets the technical requirements</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Growth:</strong> Primarily focused on boosting critical KPIs like user engagement, revenue, project management resources, and conversion rates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Digital/Platform:</strong> They are&nbsp; involved in digital products such as apps, websites, and online platforms. They may work in a variety of businesses, but their primary focus is on the digital parts of the product</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Data:</strong> Engage with products that revolve around data, analytics, and insights. They aim to improve the product and make data-driven decisions by utilizing data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nOver the last 10 years with the rise of Product Led Growth (PLG), these functions have co-existed and thrived, but in this new age of AI, all the roles are going to be transformed. Product managers must appreciate the potential, and potential pitfalls of AI and machine learning to drive innovation and competitive advantage. Understanding these technologies empowers PMs to create adaptable, high-performance products that meet dynamic market demands and provide exceptional user experiences.</p>\n<h2 id=\"understandingai\">Understanding AI</h2>\n<p>One of the most important things to understand before deep diving into AI is to understand it. AI is a multidisciplinary branch of science and engineering dedicated to creating systems capable of performing tasks that would require human or higher levels of intelligence. AI systems can process information, recognize patterns, make decisions nearing human capabilities.Furthermore, AI encompasses various subfields, such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Machine learning</strong>, a subset of AI, focuses on developing algorithms that allow machines to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Natural language processing</strong> enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language, facilitating communication between humans and machines.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nAs AI has been steadily gaining ground in other industries, its also been transforming Product Management by providing new techniques of growth and efficiency. Here are some of the ways in which AI is going to transform Product Management.</p>\n<h3 id=\"revolutionizinguserfeedbackwithaiintegration\">Revolutionizing User Feedback with AI Integration</h3>\n<p>User feedback is invaluable in understanding user experiences and identifying areas of improvement. AI-powered tools can automatically analyze user feedback, identify recurring themes, and prioritize product enhancements based on customer sentiments. Automated customer interaction and feedback collection tools, such as AI-powered chatbots, could revolutionize the process of gathering feedback and user queries in real-time. These tools could not only gather feedback but also analyze it, transforming it into actionable insights.Furthermore, AI can also help product managers gain deeper insights from user feedback by analyzing sentiment and emotion. By understanding the underlying emotions behind user feedback, product managers can better empathize with their users and tailor their product strategies accordingly.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Example</strong>: MonkeyLearn or Clarabridge, can analyze customer feedback in real-time.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/7WUnLqswtST7p9EJKcWdJr6eFlz1-2024-12-03T05:06:10.254Z-uej5a5yzmvtkkflr4cau7yyq\" alt=\"AI powered Feedback collection (Source: Akkio.com)\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"rapidprototypingandmockgeneration\">Rapid Prototyping and Mock Generation</h3>\n<p>Product managers rely extensively on mocks, wireframes and prototypes to communicate concepts, gather feedback and drive consensus. Traditionally, crafting these assets requires extensive manual effort from skilled designers or product managers. When working in a fast-paced environment where being first to market is critical, speeding up the process from concept to visualization is critical.</p>\n<p>\\\nAdvances in AI now provide product managers and designers with natural language-based tools to mock up concepts without intensive manual work. Interfaces allow PMs and designers to describe desired layouts, components and journeys in everyday language. AI drawing assistants automatically generate detailed mocks, wireframes and clickable prototypes matching the specifications. AI systems give product managers the autonomy to materialize visions quickly. The new process enables efficient conveyance of ideas to stakeholders for feedback, estimating viability and facilitating user tests to refine concepts. And it’s not just mockups; AI can also create user journeys, storyboards and other user experience deliverables to assist you with innovative customer-centric solutions.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Example</strong>: creating a simple product which improves code maintenance. Rapid prototyping can be done embedding LLM through prompts and storing them in Chroma Db. This can be used to understand the feasibility of the product and quickly iterate if the first approach fails.</p>\n<p>\\\n\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/7WUnLqswtST7p9EJKcWdJr6eFlz1-2024-12-03T05:06:10.254Z-ba80wdepdweu5re0lj3uglj8\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"effectivelyusingaiprompts\">Effectively using AI Prompts</h3>\n<p>AI large language models such as ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Gemini, Mistral have given windows for people to ask questions and get information at their fingertips, product managers need to understand what prompts are going to give them their best results.</p>\n<p>\\\nPrompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining prompts—questions or instructions—to elicit specific responses from AI models. Think of it as the interface between human intent and machine output. In the vast realm of AI, where models are trained on enormous datasets, the right prompt can be the difference between a model understanding your request or misinterpreting it.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Prompt Writing:</strong> Prompt needs to be descriptive, additionally it would be helpful to provide examples of desired output. Overall the product managers need to avoid ambiguity and break down complex tasks into steps</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Prompt Testing & Iteration:</strong> After writing the prompts, it's important to test whether it actually addressed the scenario. A product manager will need to  is a systematically refine and improving prompts used in AI interactions through repeated testing and modification. This iterative approach involves creating initial prompts, evaluating their effectiveness, and making incremental changes to enhance the quality, relevance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nOverall if product manager master the techniques of AI prompting, they can seamlessly integrate LLM outputs into their work-stream such as roadmapping and as the LLMs is also continuously enhancing based on the user inputs.</p>\n<p>\\\nHere is quick prompt workflow for Product managers:</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/7WUnLqswtST7p9EJKcWdJr6eFlz1-1613dqo.jpeg\" alt=\"Path of Prompt Engineering (Source: InclusionCloud.com)\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"gainingcompetitiveedgethroughaiimplementation\">Gaining Competitive Edge Through AI Implementation</h3>\n<p>In a competitive market, gaining a competitive edge is essential for product success. AI can provide valuable insights on market trends, competitor analysis, and customer behavior, empowering product managers to make informed decisions and adapt their strategies accordingly. By harnessing AI, product managers can stay ahead of the curve and gain a competitive edge in their respective industries.</p>\n<p>\\\nFor example, AI can analyze vast amounts of data from various sources, such as social media, customer reviews, and industry reports, to identify emerging trends and patterns. Sentiment analysis helps businesses adapt to consumer desires, monitor brand perceptions, and identify influencers. AI-powered chatbots provide instant support, while predictive analytics refine marketing strategies, ensuring businesses stay competitive in the dynamic social media landscape.This information can help product managers anticipate market shifts and adapt their product strategies accordingly. By being proactive rather than reactive, product managers can position their products ahead of the competition.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/7WUnLqswtST7p9EJKcWdJr6eFlz1-2024-12-03T05:06:10.263Z-zh4l39hx3uoi2h0ks8acr31s\" alt=\"Trend Analysis using Modern LLMs (Source: LeewayHertz.com)\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The future of product management is intrinsically linked with AI and this integration offers unprecedented opportunities for growth, efficiency, and innovation.</p>\n<p>\\\nAs we navigate the challenges and seize the opportunities AI offers, it's important to remember AI is here to augment our capabilities and not replace humans as product managers.

On the flip side, building for specific use cases is more aligned with the spirit of decentralization.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe goal here is to build technologies that can be combined or remixed to reach internet scale via supporting communities.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The crux of the debate is whether or not onchain technologies can really scale in a way that allows them to maintain the values of what makes them unique or alternative in the first place.</p>\n<p>\\\nHere’s a quick breakdown of the two scaling strategies and then a take on which route makes the most sense.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/xP5lHtN0vMf7waCL6tGSabhVnru2-2024-12-03T05:28:30.644Z-r4md1laajkmg6anx4wfj0e38\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Maybe the best scaling solution is more time. <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Comparison-of-Internet-and-Cryptocurrency-Adoption-from-2014-2024-Source-Wan-S-2021_fig1_379927920?ref=danielmcglynn.com\">SOURCE</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"buildforbilions\">Build for Bilions</h2>\n<p>The build-for-billions mentality makes sense when thinking about internet scale.</p>\n<p>\\\nOne of the great things about building for the internet is that, for the first time in human history, you can build goods and services that are global and universal in a way.</p>\n<p>\\\nAnother advantage is <a href=\"https://www.danielmcglynn.com/the-value-of-a-network/\">network effects</a> or the idea that an app or service becomes more valuable the more people use it.</p>\n<p>\\\nDuring the Devconflict debate, both sides kept pointing toward messaging services like WhatsApp that have successfully reached a billion users.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo reach that scale requires getting a lot of things right. Maybe the thing that a product like WhatsApp got right is solving a fundamental need.</p>\n<p>\\\nMessaging apps are a great example because they solve the fundamental problem of making it easy and cheap to communicate with other people.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhat’s interesting about a product like WhatsApp is that the real utility — the end-to-end encryption is not the main feature that helped onboard its billion users. Instead, people use WhatsApp because it’s easy to use and it’s easy to find other people to connect with. </p>\n<p>\\\nLikewise, like messaging, many onchain products solve fundamental needs like making it easy and cost-effective to send, receive, or collect digital assets.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn the spirit of build-for-billions, blockchain-based services should abstract away friction points like wallet key management or interoperability issues that make it complex to navigate between one product and the next.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe issue is that a lot of the complexity inherent in the product design of blockchain-based services is there for a reason.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe risk is that oversimplifying something like <a href=\"https://www.danielmcglynn.com/non-custodial-wallet/\">wallet key management</a> requires handing control back over to a company or organization rather than an individual user, which could potentially lead back to a web2 user experience.</p>\n<p>\\\nSo the tricky part with onchain products and services is to build for billions but in ways that empower users rather than just recreate new versions of already existing technologies.</p>\n<p>\\\nAfter all, while it is true that one of the fundamental reasons a service like WhatsApp was able to reach a billion users is because it is essentially “free.”</p>\n<p>\\\nBut the app is monetized via data collection for targeted advertising, which doesn’t exactly fit into the ethos or principles of building onchain.</p>\n<h2 id=\"buildfornichesofengagedusers\">Build for niches of engaged users</h2>\n<p>The alternative to building new internet technologies that don’t require billions of users to become successful is to build more precise solutions for a smaller group of users.</p>\n<p>\\\nBuilding specific solutions enables two things:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Products can be tailored, customized, or precise to solve a well-defined issue.</li>\n<li>Products and services can exist that aren’t necessarily billion-dollar businesses, but still generate a lot of value for end-users and the people creating them.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\nBuilding a successful product that is used and loved by hundreds of thousands or even millions of people can be really useful, but is it mainstream or even a name brand? And does that even matter?</p>\n<p>\\\nProbably what matters more is if the product can operate in a way that is sustainable and can create value for the team who created and maintain it.</p>\n<p>\\\nOne of the promises of building onchain is that it enables new kinds of economies — more internet-native economies — that don’t require the same kind of big box store, mainstream media, kind of approach to success.</p>\n<p>\\\nPut another way, maybe the goal of building for billions is antiquated — or like the Walmart of the digital age.</p>\n<p>\\\nMaybe instead the goal should be to build small specialized stacks of products that can be easily stacked and combined with related products to build suites of services that leverage things like network effects and global access, but do it in a way that is also extremely custom and bespoke.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoachieveinternetscalewhilestayingtruetoopenpermissionlessaccessandnoncustodialcontrol\">How to achieve internet scale while staying true to open, permissionless access and non-custodial control?</h2>\n<p>The most obvious answer to the question about how to scale new kinds of internet services is just to build products that are better than anything that exists right now.</p>\n<p>\\\nFor people concerned about privacy, that means building the best privacy product — one that delivers both the best user experience and the best alignment with privacy-preserving principles.</p>\n<p>\\\nFor people with concerns about having their retirement funds rugged by banks, it means building a streamlined non-custodial experience — one where key management becomes as easy as saving a username and password.</p>\n<p>\\\nFor people worried about the rise in nationalism and closing borders, it means building technologies that are global and multicultural at the foundation — where there is no off switch available to politicians or people pretending to be politicians.</p>\n<p>\\\nMaybe the key to scale is not so much thinking about success in the traditional web2 context of milestones of millions of users.</p>\n<p>\\\nMaybe the right way to think about scale for onchain services and beyond is to think about how the product is <a href=\"https://www.danielmcglynn.com/composable-design/\">composable</a>, durable, and accessible.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf the answer is yes then it can become part of the fabric of the open internet. The product or service might even get remixed into something else or used by some other project.</p>\n<p>\\\nAfter all, the internet works best when it operates as networks of networks — guided by rails of common protocols — but is also dynamic, open, and adaptable.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis post is part of the <a href=\"https://www.danielmcglynn.com/\">Open Money</a> project.</p>",

The number of homes and businesses with a solar installation clicked past 4 million -- barely 20 years since there was practically none anywhere in the country. It is a love affair that shows few signs of stopping. \n\nAnd it's a technology that is having ever greater effects, not just on the bills of its household users but on the very energy system itself. At no time of the year is that effect more obvious than spring, when solar output soars as the days grow longer and sunnier but demand remains subdued as mild temperatures mean people leave their air conditioners switched off. \n\nSuch has been the extraordinary production of solar in Australia this spring, the entire state of South Australia has -- at various times -- met all of its electricity needs from the technology. \n\n[...] [T]here is, at times, too much solar power in Australia's electricity systems to handle.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Australia+Struggling+With+Oversupply+of+Solar+Power%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F03%2F0421204%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F03%2F0421204%2Faustralia-struggling-with-oversupply-of-solar-power%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://slashdot.org/story/24/12/03/0421204/australia-struggling-with-oversupply-of-solar-power?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23539777&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

      "content": "<p>\\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is quickly transforming industries. In line with this, the need for strong AI security has grown more critical than ever. Aporia, a provider of AI guardrails and observability solutions, has launched its \"<strong><a href=\"https://www.aporia.com/securing-ai-sucks/\">Securing AI Sucks</a></strong>” campaign to address this urgent issue.</p>\n<p>\\n <strong>What is Aporia?</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nAporia, founded in 2019, has quickly become a trusted partner for Fortune 500 companies and leading AI teams worldwide. The company specializes in advanced AI guardrails and observability solutions for all AI workloads, revamping AI model security and monitoring.</p>\n<p>\\\nOrganizations can easily add Aporia's modern guardrails within minutes and fully customize them to protect various AI applications from common issues such as hallucinations, prompt injection attacks, toxicity, and off-topic responses.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Campaign Overview</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nThe \"Securing AI Sucks\" campaign by Aporia addresses a critical concern in the AI industry: the complexity and risks associated with securing AI systems. Through extensive research involving over 1,500 discussions among chief information security officers (CISOs) and security specialists, Aporia has identified a common theme: securing AI systems is complex and involves risks.</p>\n<p>\\n The campaign demonstrates the dangers of ignoring AI security. As AI systems become more common and often handle sensitive information, they become prime targets for data breaches, adversarial attacks, and unauthorized access. The consequences of poor security can be severe, ranging from loss of customer trust and legal penalties to potential harm to users.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Key Features of the Campaign</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nAporia's campaign focuses on several crucial aspects of AI security: 88% of CISOs are concerned about the unpredictability of AI systems, making it challenging to implement good security measures.</p>\n<p>\\\nAround 78% of security professionals disagree or strongly disagree that conventional security tools are sufficient for addressing AI-specific vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, 85% of CISOs face substantial challenges when adding security measures to their existing AI systems, and 80% of security professionals find identifying and monitoring AI applications challenging or extremely challenging.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe campaign also introduces the concept of AI Guardrails as a solution to these challenges. Positioned between homegrown AI agents, users, and third-party AI tools, these guardrails act as a much-needed security layer, instantly reviewing every message and interaction to establish compliance with established rules.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Real-life Examples of AI Security Failures</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nThe campaign presents several real-world scenarios to show the importance of AI security. For instance, a company's AI assistant unintentionally shared confidential financial projections, leading to significant losses and reputational damage.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo solve this, the solution involves confidential data access control. Instead of responding with the projected revenue and profit, the AI’s answer would be blocked and rephrased by the Guardrails, replying, <em>“I am sorry, but I cannot provide this information. Please use this system responsibly.”</em></p>\n<p>\\n Another example, SecureCorp, showed an employee who faced challenges while writing a complex client proposal. The individual used an external generative AI service to save time, inputting sensitive client information to generate content. The external AI service stored the data, which later appeared in publicly available outputs, exposing confidential client details.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe solution is implementing AI guardrails that detect when an employee attempts to input sensitive information into external AI services. The system’s response would be rephrased by the Guardrails to say: <em>\"Warning: Uploading sensitive data to external services is prohibited. Please use approved internal tools for handling confidential information.\"</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Impact and Results</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nAporia's thorough strategy for solving security challenges will resonate with organizations struggling with these issues. Offering AI Guardrails as a solution, Aporia positions itself as a thought leader in the AI security space.</p>\n<p>\\\nUndeniably, Aporia's \"Securing AI Sucks\" campaign brings to light the challenges in AI security while offering new solutions. As AI continues to change and integrate into various aspects of business and society, the importance of strong security measures cannot be overstated. Aporia's campaign raises awareness about these issues and presents a way forward for organizations looking to secure AI systems well.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<hr />\n<p>:::info\nThis article is published under HackerNoon’s Business Blogging program.

      "content": "<p>Do you want a phone with a clean Android experience, exceptional camera software and seamless integration with the Google Ecosystem? Well, Google Pixel has earned the reputation of providing the best Android experience to date. But as more and more pixel devices fly off the shelves, there has been not one but many eyebrows raised about the privacy issues of these slick gadgets. Are these Pixel phones just some shiny devices cleverly disguised as spy devices? Are we being tricked into giving Google access to siphon our data? </p>\n<p>\\\nRead on. We’ll separate speculation from reality, in this article. </p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"thegoogleecosystemadatadrivengiant\">The Google Ecosystem: A Data-Driven Giant</h2>\n<p>To dig into the privacy debate around Pixel phones, the main elephant in the room to address is the business model of Google. At its core, Google operates on a freemium model in the form of Google Maps, Gmail, and YouTube. But are these services really “free”? Well, definitely not, because you, the consumer, are the payment.</p>\n<p>\\\nIt is the data we feed these “free” services that help run the colossal machine. Google uses your data—your personal preferences, choices, and everything else—to target relevant ads. And companies, in turn, pay Google hefty sums to reach their targeted audiences. Google has often gotten in trouble with <strong><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/google-says-it-doesnt-sell-your-data-heres-how-company-shares-monetizes-and\">lawsuits for stealing user information and selling it</a></strong> to third parties.</p>\n<p>\\\nNaturally, Pixel is heavily entwined in the Google Ecosystem. Everything from Google Assistant to Google Photos provides these shiny devices a gateway into your personal life. It is like giving Dracula an unlimited supply of fresh blood to leech on.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"howmuchdatadopixelphonescollect\">How Much Data Do Pixel Phones Collect?</h3>\n<p>Since your phones are with you at all times, a crazy amount of data is collected from you. Here is an insight into all the data Google has access to:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Location Tracking:</strong> Pixel phones come equipped with GPS capabilities. Now you might be thinking, <em>Hey, isn’t that standard for every smartphone?</em> Well, what sets Google apart is its detailed tracking. For instance, if you enable “Google Location History,” your Pixel phone logs every place you visit.</p>\n<p>\\\nYou might be thinking, <em>Why can’t we turn this off?</em> Too bad—turning it off doesn’t necessarily mean you are off Google’s radar. <strong><a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2020/Aug/04/2002469874/-1/-1/0/CSI_LIMITING_LOCATION_DATA_EXPOSURE_FINAL.PDF\">Many reports suggest</a></strong> that disabling location services only limits tracking to a degree. Additionally, other data points such as Wi-Fi signals can still be used to infer your whereabouts.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><p><strong>Voice Data:</strong> How many times a day do you open your Android and say the words, “Hey Google!” to perform a range of tasks? Well, this magical element is only possible when the device listens continuously for the “wake-up” words. Although Google claims that it doesn’t store your conversations, snippets are often analyzed to improve services. Additionally, the majority of Google Assistant users have also enabled the “train your voice” feature, allowing the device to store and analyze your daily voice data for a better experience. A few years ago, it was revealed that <strong><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/11/google-admits-leaked-private-voice-conversations.html\">these audio clips were leaked</a></strong>—a major privacy red flag!</p>\n<p>\\\nFortunately, you can delete these recordings via Google Account settings. However, you must actively do this yourself, and let’s be honest—how many of us bother?</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Search and Usage Patterns:</strong> Pixel phones are deeply integrated with Google services, which means every Google search, YouTube video, and app download becomes part of your digital footprint. Google can analyze this data to create a detailed profile of your preferences, habits, and even vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>\\\nAgain, this isn’t unique to Pixel. Any smartphone, from iPhones to Samsungs, collects usage data. But Google’s dominance in search and ads makes this feel more intrusive.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"whataboutthehardware\">What About the Hardware?</h2>\n<p>Pixel phones contain impressive hardware, but does this hardware further assist Google in spying on us? Well, there is no conclusive evidence that Pixel phones use physical components to collect more data. Nevertheless, the Google software and operating system incorporate hardware such as the microphone and camera as vectors for unauthorized data collection.</p>\n<p>\\\nAn ongoing debate between Google and Apple also highlights the difference. Apple’s revenue model relies on selling premium hardware, which makes it less dependent on ads and user data. Google, on the other hand, profits from data. This makes it important for Google to have an ample amount of data to be fruitful, which further fuels suspicion about the Pixel phones and their credibility.</p>\n<h2 id=\"privacyfeaturesgooglesattempttowintrust\">Privacy Features: Google’s Attempt to Win Trust</h2>\n<p>To combat privacy concerns, Google has rolled out features aimed at transparency and control. For instance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Privacy Dashboard: Introduced with Android 12, this feature lets you see which apps are accessing your location, camera, and microphone. It even offers toggles to turn off these permissions.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p>End-to-End Encryption: Google Messages now supports end-to-end encryption for one-on-one chats, making it harder for anyone to snoop on your conversations.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p>Federated Learning: Pixel phones use on-device machine learning to power features like predictive typing. This means data processing happens locally, without sending information to the cloud.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>While these steps are commendable, skeptics argue that they don’t address the elephant in the room: Google’s overarching dependence on data and the usage of Pixel hardware as a handy source for it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"shouldyoubeworried\">Should You Be Worried?</h2>\n<p>If you’re a typical user who loves the convenience of Google services, a Pixel phone is unlikely to make you a victim of Orwellian surveillance. However, if you’re a journalist, activist, or privacy hawk, you might find Google’s data practices unsettling.</p>\n<h4 id=\"pros\">Pros:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Pixel phones offer unparalleled integration with Google services.</li>\n<li>Privacy features like the Privacy Dashboard and encrypted messaging are useful tools.</li>\n<li>Regular security updates keep your device protected from external threats.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"cons\">Cons:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The deep integration with Google services comes at the cost of extensive data collection.</li>\n<li>Despite privacy controls, the default settings are often pro-data collection, requiring users to opt out actively.</li>\n<li>Trusting Google with your data might feel like trusting a fox to guard the henhouse.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howtosafeguardyourprivacy\">How to Safeguard Your Privacy?</h2>\n<p>If you’re concerned about Pixel phones snooping on you, here are some tips:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Review Permissions: Use the Privacy Dashboard to revoke unnecessary permissions.</li>\n<li>Use Alternatives: Replace default apps with privacy-focused alternatives, like DuckDuckGo for browsing.</li>\n<li>Turn Off Always-On Features: Disable “Hey Google” and other background listening features.</li>\n<li>Regularly Delete Data: Clear your Google Account activity history and disable ad personalization.</li>\n<li>Consider a VPN: Encrypt your internet traffic to add an extra layer of security.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"theverdict\">The Verdict</h3>\n<p>The main question you need to ask yourself is: how much do you trust Google? If you are okay with sharing your whereabouts and other data in exchange for the convenience of free applications like YouTube and Google Maps, Pixel phones are a perfect choice for you. They have good hardware, some of the best software, and longer updates than other Android phones. But if privacy is your priority, it is better to take extra precautions and avoid Pixel phones.</p>\n<p>\\\nUltimately, it boils down to how much you trust Google. If you value convenience and are okay with sharing data in exchange for free services, Pixel phones are a great choice. But if privacy is your top priority, you might want to explore alternatives—or take extra steps to shield yourself while using a Pixel.</p>\n<p>\\\nEither way, one thing is certain: in the current digital age, it is very difficult to remain off the grid. This is not an option since everything, every step, is connected through the internet, leaving traces. Therefore, the best way is to stay informed, vigilant, and be sure to ask Google every now and then, “Hey Google, are you spying on me?”</p>\n<p>\\</p>",

From a report: In his first major speech since joining the NCSC -- part of the signals and cyber intelligence agency GCHQ -- Richard Horne will drive a shift in tone in how the cybersecurity agency communicates these risks. Despite some evidence showing cyberattacks growing year-on-year for half a decade, the NCSC has not previously confirmed the trend nor expressed alarm about it. \n\n\"What has struck me more forcefully than anything else since taking the helm at the NCSC is the clearly widening gap between the exposure and threat we face, and the defences that are in place to protect us,\" Horne will say, according to an advance preview of his speech on Tuesday. Citing the intelligence that NCSC has access to as an agency within GCHQ, Horne will warn that \"hostile activity in UK cyberspace has increased in frequency, sophistication and intensity,\" adding that despite growing activity from Russian and Chinese threat actors, the agency believes British society as a whole is failing to appreciate the severity of the risk. The annual review reveals that the agency's incident management team handled a record number of cyber incidents over the past 12 months -- 430 compared to 371 last year -- 89 of which were considered nationally significant incidents.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=UK+Cyber+Chief+Warns+Country+'Widely+Underestimating'+Risks+From+Cyberattacks%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F03%2F1413226%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F03%2F1413226%2Fuk-cyber-chief-warns-country-widely-underestimating-risks-from-cyberattacks%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/03/1413226/uk-cyber-chief-warns-country-widely-underestimating-risks-from-cyberattacks?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23540137&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

That frustration, along with the vision of legendary minds like Ken Thompson, Rob Pike, and Robert Griesemer, led to the creation of <strong>Golang (or simply, Go)</strong> in 2007. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)\">Designed at Google to address the unique challenges of large-scale software projects</a>, Go embodies the principle of “less is more” in programming. But how did it grow into the powerhouse it is today? Let’s explore together.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"thebirthofgofromfrustrationtoinnovation\"><strong>The Birth of Go: From Frustration to Innovation</strong></h3>\n<p>It was 2007, and Google’s engineers were battling a giant. That giant? The slow, cumbersome <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-use-Java-if-it-is-so-freaking-slow\">compile times of C++ and Java</a>. With Google scaling faster than anyone could have imagined, these languages—powerful as they were—felt like using crude tools like hoes, rakes, and hand rakes for industrialized farming.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/szRhcSkT6Vb1JUUrwXMB3X2GOqu2-b2036er.jpeg\" alt=\"Never Go Easy.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n\\\nRobert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson realized they needed a solution. They didn't begin with the idea of creating a new language; instead, they asked themselves: How can we make software development smarter and faster?</p>\n<p>\\\nThe challenge was clear: balancing performance, simplicity, and scalability was nearly impossible with the tools available. Long compilations ate into productivity. Writing concurrent code to use multicore CPUs was difficult. And as systems grew, maintaining clarity in massive codebases felt like taming a wild beast.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/szRhcSkT6Vb1JUUrwXMB3X2GOqu2-711368n.jpeg\" alt=\"🙂🥲\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n\\\nHowever, there was a way forward. The <strong>three wise men</strong> thought of a language that removed complexity without losing power— so in essence, a “C for the 21st century.” They doubled down on simplicity, concise syntax, and a concurrency model built for the new distributed, networked world.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn 2009, <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=1sFWCwAAQBAJ&printsec=copyright\">the world was introduced to </a><strong><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=1sFWCwAAQBAJ&printsec=copyright\">Go</a></strong>, and by 2012, it became open source. It didn’t just solve Google’s problems—it changed how modern tools like Docker and Kubernetes were built, showing the world what simplicity and speed could achieve.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/szRhcSkT6Vb1JUUrwXMB3X2GOqu2-si236w3.jpeg\" alt=\"Isn't he just cute 🥺.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n\\\nGo's mascot, the friendly Gopher, symbolizes its philosophy—practical, approachable, and designed for everyone.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"simplicitywithapunch\">Simplicity with a Punch</h2>\n<p>Back then, programming languages were usually designed to do everything, Go chose a different path. It’s not about cramming in features but about trimming out the fat, focusing on what truly matters.</p>\n<h3 id=\"blinkandyouredone\"><strong>Blink and You’re Done</strong></h3>\n<p>Ever stared at a screen, waiting for your code to compile, feeling the seconds stretch into eternity? Go made that a thing of the past. Innovations in <strong>dependency analysis</strong> means Go builds projects in record time. <strong>But</strong> speed doesn’t come at the expense of reliability. Go ensures everything works seamlessly, like cutting through butter with a hot knife.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"multitaskingthegoway\"><strong>Multitasking, the Go Way</strong></h3>\n<p>The world has become hyper-connected, apps need to handle thousands, if not <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/5-key-load-balancer-performance-metrics-you-should-track\">millions, of concurrent operations</a>. <strong>However</strong>, traditional methods can be clunky and resource heavy. Go’s lightweight threads, called <strong>goroutines</strong>, allow you to run multiple tasks simultaneously without breaking a sweat.</p>\n<h3 id=\"statictypingsimple\"><em>Static Typing – Simple</em></h3>\n<p>Some languages slow you down with verbose declarations (Java: <code>private final Integer myIntegerVariable = Integer.valueOf(42);</code> vs Go: <code>myIntegerVariable := 42</code>), while others go too far into dynamic chaos. Go finds the sweet spot. <strong>Therefore</strong>, you get the safety of static typing—catching bugs before they cause problems—paired with clean syntax.</p>\n<h4 id=\"nomoreheaderfilesorclassestheminimalistsdream\"><strong>No More Header Files or Classes: The Minimalist’s Dream</strong></h4>\n<p>In languages like C++, header files can quickly pile up, creating clutter and confusion. And classes? They can be excessive, leading to complex hierarchies that are difficult to manage.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"c++ language-c++\">// Shape.h\n#ifndef SHAPE_H\n#define SHAPE_H\n\nclass Shape {\npublic:\n    virtual double area() const = 0;\n};\n\n#endif\n\n#ifndef CIRCLE_H\n#define CIRCLE_H\n\n#include \"Shape.h\"\n#include &lt;cmath&gt;\n\nclass Circle : public Shape {\nprivate:\n    double radius;\n\npublic:\n    Circle(double r) : radius(r) {}\n    double area() const override {\n        return M_PI * radius * radius;\n    }\n};\n\n#endif\n\n#include \"Circle.h\"\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n\nint main() {\n    Shape* circle = new Circle(5.0);\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"Area of Circle: \" &lt;&lt; circle-&gt;area() &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n    delete circle;\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Go flips the script. It replaces inheritance with <strong>composition</strong>, letting you build powerful, reusable components without drowning in boilerplate code.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"go language-go\">package main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"math\"\n)\n\n// Circle type\ntype Circle struct {\n    Radius float64\n}\n\n// Circle embeds reusable behavior without inheritance\nfunc (c Circle) Area() float64 {\n    return math.Pi * c.Radius * c.Radius\n}\n\ntype Shape interface {\n    Area() float64\n}\n\nfunc printArea(s Shape) {\n    fmt.Printf(\"Area: %.2f\\n\", s.Area())\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    circle := Circle{Radius: 5.0}\n    printArea(circle)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>But</strong> in this case simplicity actually means less headache.</p>\n<p>\\\nGo isn’t just unique because of what it includes. It’s also about what it leaves out—complexity, redundancy, and obstacles to productivity. Like a well-organized hotel room: everything you need is right there. <strong>That’s the Go philosophy.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"usecasesofgopoweringmodernsoftware\"><strong>Use Cases of Go: Powering Modern Software</strong></h2>\n<p>As a solution to unique demands of modern software development Go’s speed, simplicity, and concurrency model make it a favorite for building scalable, efficient, and maintainable systems.</p>\n<h3 id=\"webserversandapislightweightandscalable\"><strong>Web Servers and APIs: Lightweight and Scalable</strong></h3>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/szRhcSkT6Vb1JUUrwXMB3X2GOqu2-11636sj.png\" alt=\"Controlling Web Traffic\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n\\\nFor a high-traffic website like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com\">www.amazon.com</a> that needs to process thousands of requests per second, traditional languages might struggle under the load or demand complex setups to handle concurrency. <strong>But</strong> Go? It was made for pressure. With its lightweight goroutines and minimal overhead, Go powers APIs and web servers with remarkable efficiency. Tools like <strong>Gin</strong> and <strong>Fiber</strong>—popular Go web frameworks—make building RESTful services seamless. <strong>Therefore</strong>, for your small apps or the enterprise systems, Go gets the job done with speed and style.</p>\n<h3 id=\"designedfordistribution\"><strong>Designed for Distribution</strong></h3>\n<p>Cloud infrastructures are complex, they need distributed systems that are both reliable and scalable. This is where Go feels at home. Its performance, paired with a simple syntax, allows developers to focus on building resilient systems instead of having to wrestle with verbose code. <strong>But</strong> it’s not just about ease of use. Go’s role in projects like <strong>Kubernetes</strong> and <strong>Terraform</strong> shows its ability to handle cloud-scale challenges with precision. <strong>Therefore</strong>, it has become a go-to language for cloud-first applications.</p>\n<h3 id=\"microservicestheperfectfit\"><strong>Microservices: The Perfect Fit</strong></h3>\n<p>Microservices require small, independent software units that communicate efficiently. Go, with its fast startup times, small compiled binaries, and built-in concurrency model, fits this architecture like a glove. <strong>However</strong>, creating microservices is mostly about maintenance over time. Go’s minimalism ensures that every service is straightforward and easy to understand, reducing technical debt as systems grow. <strong>Therefore</strong>, it's no surprise that companies like Netflix and Uber rely on Go for their microservices architecture.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"govsthecompetitionsimplicityoverfeatureoverload\"><strong>Go vs. the Competition: Simplicity Over Feature Overload</strong></h2>\n<p>Each programming language has its strengths and weaknesses. The key to Go’s appeal lies in its <strong>simplicity and efficiency</strong>, but how does it compare to its competitors?</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/szRhcSkT6Vb1JUUrwXMB3X2GOqu2-9k336i9.png\" alt=\"Come for me.\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"govspython\"><strong>Go vs. Python</strong></h3>\n<p>Python has long been the favorite for quick development cycles. It’s flexible, with a massive ecosystem of libraries, making it ideal for everything from data science to web development. <strong>But</strong> Python’s flexibility often comes with a price: it can be <strong>slower</strong> and harder to scale in performance-critical applications.</p>\n<p>\\\nGo, on the other hand, doesn’t have the breadth of libraries that Python does, <strong>but</strong> it’s designed with <strong>speed</strong> and <strong>scalability</strong> in mind. It’s a <strong>compiled language</strong>, which means it generally outperforms Python, an interpreted language, especially for large, concurrent systems. So, if you’re building something that needs to handle massive loads—like a web server or a microservice—Go might be your better choice.</p>\n<p>\\\nPython gives you flexibility but Go trades that flexibility for <strong>speed</strong> and <strong>efficiency</strong> without sacrificing readability. It’s a balance that Python doesn’t quite manage. <strong>Therefore</strong>, when performance is crucial, Go's concise syntax and concurrency model make it stand out.</p>\n<h3 id=\"govsc\"><strong>Go vs. C++</strong></h3>\n<p>C++ is a powerful, low-level language that offers precise control over memory and execution. Developers who use C++ appreciate its <strong>flexibility</strong> and <strong>fine-tuned performance</strong>. <strong>But</strong>, with great power comes great responsibility—C++ is <strong>complex</strong> and <strong>prone to errors</strong>. Memory management, pointers, and manual optimizations can quickly spiral into a nightmare of bugs and undefined behavior.</p>\n<p>\\\nGo was created from the desire to simplify that complexity. So, it doesn't offer the same level of fine-grained control as C++, but it delivers the speed and efficiency you need for scalable systems, minus the overhead. C++ is built for <strong>performance</strong>, but Go delivers <strong>speed with simplicity</strong>—taking away the need for intricate memory management and reducing the risk of errors.</p>\n<p>While C++ can make you feel like you're driving a Bugatti car at full throttle, Go is like driving a well-tuned Tesla—<strong>efficient</strong>, <strong>fast</strong>, and easy to handle.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gosphilosophymorewithless\"><strong>Go’s Philosophy: More With Less</strong></h3>\n<p>The true beauty of Go lies in its <strong>simplicity</strong>. Go doesn’t try to be everything for everyone. <strong>Instead</strong>, it prioritizes a clean, readable syntax, fast execution, and built-in concurrency. It doesn’t have the extensive feature set of Python, nor does it offer the deep low-level control of C++. <strong>But</strong> Go provides just enough to get the job done with <strong>fewer lines of code</strong> and <strong>faster performance</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gothefutureofhighperformancedevelopment\"><strong>Go: The Future of High-Performance Development</strong></h3>\n<p>There’s a clear takeaway here: Go isn’t trying to dethrone C++ or Python. It doesn’t have to. It meets the modern demands of scalable web services, cloud computing, and microservices with a focus on simplicity, concurrency, and speed.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe catch? <strong>Traditional languages</strong> like C++ or Python may offer more features, but they require more management and sacrifice some efficiency. Go solves this by focusing on what matters most—making developers’ lives easier while delivering performance at scale.</p>\n<p>\\\nGo might not have all the bells and whistles, but it has the <strong>right tools</strong> for the job. <strong>That’s why it’s gaining popularity across modern development stacks.</strong></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"thelegacyandfutureofgo\"><em>The Legacy and Future of Go</em></h2>\n<p>Go’s journey over the last 15 years has been nothing short of impressive. From its humble beginnings at Google to becoming one of the most widely adopted programming languages in cloud computing and infrastructure, Go has shown that <strong>simplicity and speed</strong> can indeed coexist. It has reshaped how we think about and build modern software, especially as demands grow for efficiency and scalability.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/szRhcSkT6Vb1JUUrwXMB3X2GOqu2-sg436z4.png\" alt=\"Golang's adoption has grown rapidly over the years.\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n\\\nBut <strong>here’s the deal</strong>—many developers, in the pursuit of <strong>advanced features</strong> and <strong>flexibility</strong>, have often turned to languages like Python and Java. Go, however, chose a different path. Instead of piling on features, it stripped down complexity, focusing on what matters most: building <strong>fast, reliable systems</strong>. Go’s minimalist approach means that <strong>its legacy is defined by simplicity</strong>, but that doesn't mean it's stuck in the past. It’s evolving, adapting to new challenges like AI and real-time infrastructure.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Therefore</strong>, Go's future looks incredibly promising. With growing industries like <strong>cloud computing, microservices</strong>, and even <strong>AI infrastructure</strong>, Go is right where it needs to be. As the language matures, it continues to embrace changes that align with <strong>modern development needs</strong>, like the introduction of <strong>generics</strong>, which gives developers more flexibility without sacrificing simplicity.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>But</strong> what does this mean for developers today? Well, if you haven’t tried Go yet, now is the time. Go's clean syntax, combined with its efficient performance, makes it perfect for building everything from web servers to complex data processing systems. Whether you’re tackling a <strong>microservice architecture</strong>, a <strong>distributed database</strong>, or even exploring the potential of <strong>AI infrastructure</strong>, Go has the right tools for the job.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe legacy of Go isn’t just about the past—it’s about creating <strong>something remarkable and fast</strong>. So, <strong>what’s your next step</strong>? In 2025, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFfo23yIWac\">Give Go a try, experiment with new ideas</a>, and be part of the next wave of efficient, scalable software development. The <strong>future is fast,</strong> and Go is here to help you build it.</p>",

      "content": "<h3 id=\"usingcursorcanfeellikemagicuntilitdoesnt\">Using Cursor Can Feel Like Magic—Until It Doesn’t</h3>\n<p>AI-generated code can feel revolutionary—until it fails you. Why does this happen? Often, the issue isn't with the AI itself, but with the inputs we provide. AI thrives on precise and comprehensive instructions. If your prompts are unclear or lack essential context, the fault lies not with the AI but with the user.</p>\n<h3 id=\"thedevelopersdilemmacontextiseverything\">The Developer’s Dilemma: Context Is Everything</h3>\n<p>Imagine this scenario: you submit a prompt, and Cursor, the AI code editor, delivers what looks like a flawless solution. But then you run the code, and nothing works. Why? Because Cursor lacked the necessary context to understand your unique environment.</p>\n<p>\\\nHere’s what typically goes wrong:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mismatch in Operating Systems</strong>: You’re on Linux, but Cursor assumes macOS.</li>\n<li><strong>Conflicting Ports or Docker Errors</strong>: Cursor generates code oblivious to the state of your running containers.</li>\n<li><strong>Python Environment Issues</strong>: Your specific dependencies or versions don’t align with the generated code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nThese are not Cursor’s failures—they’re gaps in the context we provide. Without environmental awareness, even the smartest AI can only guess at solutions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"thesolutionintroducingcursorboost\">The Solution: Introducing CursorBoost</h3>\n<p>To bridge this gap, I created <strong>CursorBoost</strong>—a lightweight agent designed to ensure AI has the context it needs to work effectively. It captures critical details about your system in real-time and integrates them seamlessly into your AI interactions.</p>\n<p>\\\nHere’s how CursorBoost transforms your experience:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Environment Monitoring</strong>: CursorBoost actively tracks vital system details, including:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Operating System</li>\n<li>Open Ports</li>\n<li>Docker Logs</li>\n<li>Python Versions</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Dynamic Updates</strong>: The agent writes this information into a <code>.cursorrules</code> file—a centralized snapshot of your system’s state.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Prompts</strong>: By integrating this context, CursorBoost ensures that the AI generates solutions tailored to your specific environment.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\nWithout CursorBoost, the AI might suggest using port 8080—only to clash with an active process. With CursorBoost, it knows which ports are open and offers an alternative, saving you from debugging frustration.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"whycursorboostmatters\">Why CursorBoost Matters</h3>\n<p>CursorBoost takes the guesswork out of AI-assisted development, delivering practical benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Accurate Solutions</strong>: Code that aligns with your system from the start.</li>\n<li><strong>Time Saved</strong>: Fewer iterations and clarifications.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced Frustration</strong>: Debugging becomes smoother when the AI understands your setup.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nThis isn’t just about convenience—it’s about making AI truly work for you.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"reallifesuccesscursorboostatthenvidiavercelhackathon\">Real-Life Success: CursorBoost at the Nvidia &amp; Vercel Hackathon</h3>\n<p>CursorBoost was born out of necessity during an <strong>Nvidia and Vercel hackathon</strong>. The problem was personal—AI-generated solutions that didn’t align with my workflow. By solving it, I not only saved hours of development time but also won an <strong>RTX 4080 GPU signed by Jensen Huang</strong>.</p>\n<p>\\\nHowever, the real prize wasn’t the hardware—it was seeing how much more effective AI could be with the right context. CursorBoost turned my daily frustrations into a scalable solution for developers everywhere.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"thegoldenruleofpromptengineeringcontextiskey\">The Golden Rule of Prompt Engineering: Context Is Key</h3>\n<p>The quality of AI output is directly proportional to the clarity of your input. CursorBoost ensures that your AI assistant always has the context it needs to succeed. With better tools, we can spend less time troubleshooting and more time building.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"letsbuildsmartertoolstogether\">Let’s Build Smarter Tools—Together</h3>\n<p>The future of coding lies in collaboration between developers and AI. Tools like CursorBoost bridge the gap, making AI more effective and workflows more efficient.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf you’re passionate about improving developer tools or workflows, let’s connect. Together, we can make AI an even more powerful ally in coding.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Check out CursorBoost on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/grp06/cursor-boost\">https://github.com/grp06/cursor-boost</a></strong></p>",

It enables the marketplace to record each item’s seller and price, which are fundamental for marketplace operations.</p>\n<pre><code>struct Listing {\n        address seller; // NFT seller\n        uint256 price;  // NFT price\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Listing Mapping</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nThis line of code defines a <strong>nested mapping</strong> in Solidity. It is used to organize and store listings for the NFT marketplace. The outer <code>mapping</code> uses the <strong>address</strong> of an NFT contract as the key. This allows the smart contract to categorize listings by their associated NFT contract addresses, ensuring multiple NFT collections can be handled.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe inner <code>mapping</code> uses the <strong>token ID</strong> (a unique identifier for each NFT) as the key. This allows the marketplace to efficiently handle listings for multiple tokens under a single NFT contract.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<pre><code> // NFT Contract =&gt; Token ID =&gt; Listing\n    mapping(address =&gt; mapping(uint256 =&gt; Listing)) public listings;\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\n<strong>NFT Listing</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nThe <code>listNFT</code>  function allows users to list their nft for sale on the nft marketplace. This function takes in three parameters, nftcontract, tokenId and price, the nftcontract is the address of the nft collection from which the user wants to list, the tokenId is the uinque id of the user’s nft in the collection and the price is the amount in which the user wants to sell the nft.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe function validates that the user owns the nft and ensures that the user enters a price greater than zero. After all validations, the nft is transferred from the seller to the nft marketplace, the listing mapping is updated, and the Listed event is emitted with the correct parameters.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<pre><code>function listNFT(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId, uint256 price)\n        external\n        notListed(nftContract, tokenId)\n    {\n        require(price &gt; 0, \"Price must be greater than zero\");\n        require(IERC721(nftContract).ownerOf(tokenId) == msg.sender, \"not owner\");\n        IERC721(nftContract).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), tokenId);\n        listings[nftContract][tokenId] = Listing(msg.sender, price);\n        emit Listed(nftContract, tokenId, msg.sender, price);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Buying NFT</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nThe <code>buyNFT</code> function enables users to purchase an NFT listed on the marketplace. It takes two parameters: <code>nftContract</code> (the address of the NFT's smart contract) and <code>tokenId</code> (the unique identifier of the NFT being purchased).</p>\n<p>\\\nThe function first validates that the buyer has sent sufficient Ether to cover the NFT's price. Once the validation is successful, the listing entry for the NFT is removed from the <code>listings</code> mapping. The payment is then securely transferred to the seller, and the NFT is transferred from the marketplace contract to the buyer's address, completing the purchase.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<pre><code>function buyNFT(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId)\n        public\n        payable\n        isListed(nftContract, tokenId)\n    {\n        Listing memory listing = listings[nftContract][tokenId];\n        require(msg.value &gt;= listing.price, \"Insufficient funds\");\n        // Remove listing\n        delete listings[nftContract][tokenId];\n        // Transfer payment to the seller\n        (bool sent, ) = listing.seller.call{value: listing.price}(\"\");\n        require(sent, \"Failed to send Ether\");\n        // Transfer NFT to the buyer\n        IERC721(nftContract).transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, tokenId);\n        emit Purchase(nftContract, tokenId, msg.sender, listing.price);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Buying Multiple NFTs</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nThe <code>buyMultipleNFT</code> function allows a user to purchase multiple NFTs in a single transaction. It first calculates the total price for all the NFTs by summing the prices of the individual NFTs listed in the <code>tokenIds</code> array. The function then checks if the buyer has sent sufficient funds to cover the total price.</p>\n<p>\\\nOnce the funds are validated, the function iterates through the <code>tokenIds</code> array, calling the <code>buyNFT</code> function for each NFT in the list. This ensures that each NFT is purchased individually, with payment being sent to the seller and the NFTs transferred to the buyer, similar to the process in the <code>buyNFT</code> function described above.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<pre><code>function buyMultipleNFT(address nftContract, uint256 [] memory tokenIds)\n        external\n        payable\n    {\n        uint256 totalAmount;\n        for (uint256 i; i &lt; tokenIds.length; i++){\n           Listing memory listing = listings[nftContract][tokenIds[i]];\n           totalAmount += listing.price;\n        }\n        require(msg.value &gt;= totalAmount, \"Insufficient funds\");\n        for (uint256 i; i &lt; tokenIds.length; i++){\n           buyNFT(nftContract, tokenIds[i]);   \n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Delisting NFTs</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nThe <code>delistNFT</code> function allows a seller to remove their NFT from the marketplace. It first verifies that the NFT is listed and that the caller is the seller of the NFT. After the validation, it deletes the listing from the marketplace, effectively removing it from the sale.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe function then transfers the NFT back to the seller, ensuring that the seller regains possession of their asset. The event <code>Delisted</code> is emitted to notify that the NFT has been delisted successfully.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<pre><code>function delistNFT(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId)\n        external\n        isListed(nftContract, tokenId)\n        isSeller(nftContract, tokenId, msg.sender)\n    {\n        Listing memory listing = listings[nftContract][tokenId];\n\n        // Remove listing\n        delete listings[nftContract][tokenId];\n        // Return NFT to the seller\n        IERC721(nftContract).transferFrom(address(this), listing.seller, tokenId);\n        emit Delisted(nftContract, tokenId, listing.seller);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Key Events</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nThe contract emits events for critical actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listed</strong>: Triggered when an NFT is listed, providing details such as the seller, price, and NFT details.</li>\n<li><strong>Purchase</strong>: Captures the buyer’s purchase details, aiding in transaction traceability.</li>\n<li><strong>Delisted</strong>: Indicates that a listing was successfully removed, ensuring transparency.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"tests\"><strong>Tests</strong></h2>\n<p>Create a NFT.sol file in the src folder and add the code below to the file.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<pre><code>// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.18;\nimport \"lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol\";\nimport \"lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\";\ncontract NFT is ERC721, Ownable {\n    uint256 private _tokenIdCounter;\n    string private _baseTokenURI;\n    event Minted(address indexed to, uint256 tokenId);\n    constructor(string memory name, string memory symbol, string memory baseTokenURI) ERC721(name, symbol) Ownable(msg.sender) {\n        _baseTokenURI = baseTokenURI;\n    }\n    /// @dev Function to mint a new NFT\n    function mint(address to) external onlyOwner {\n        uint256 tokenId = _tokenIdCounter;\n        _tokenIdCounter += 1;\n        _safeMint(to, tokenId);\n        emit Minted(to, tokenId);\n    }\n    /// @dev Override base token URI for metadata\n    function _baseURI() internal view override returns (string memory) {\n        return _baseTokenURI;\n    }\n    /// @dev Function to update the base token URI\n    function setBaseTokenURI(string memory newBaseTokenURI) external onlyOwner {\n        _baseTokenURI = newBaseTokenURI;\n    }\n    /// @dev Function to retrieve the current token ID count\n    function getTokenCount() external view returns (uint256) {\n        return _tokenIdCounter;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nCreate a market.t.sol file in the test folder and add the code below to the file:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<pre><code>// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED\npragma solidity ^0.8.13;\nimport {Test, console} from \"forge-std/Test.sol\";\nimport {NFTMarketplace} from \"../src/Market.sol\";\nimport {NFT} from \"../src/NFT.sol\";\ncontract MarketTest is Test {\n    NFTMarketplace public market;\n    NFT public nft;\n    address public user1 = makeAddr(\"user1\");\n    address public user2 = makeAddr(\"user2\");\n    address public user3 = makeAddr(\"user3\");\n    function setUp() public {\n        nft = new NFT(\"TestNFT\", \"tnft\", \"\");\n        market = new NFTMarketplace();\n        nft.mint(user1);\n        nft.mint(user1);\n        nft.mint(user1);\n    }\n    function test_Listing() public {\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        nft.approve(address(market), 0);\n        market.listNFT(address(nft), 0, 1 ether);\n\n    }\n\n     function test_BuyingNFT() public {\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        nft.approve(address(market), 0);\n        market.listNFT(address(nft), 0, 1 ether);\n\n        vm.startPrank(user2);\n        deal(user2, 10 ether);\n        market.buyNFT{value: 1 ether}(address(nft), 0);\n        assert(nft.ownerOf(0) == user2);\n\n    }\n\n      function test_BuyingMultipleNFT() public {\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        nft.approve(address(market), 0);\n        nft.approve(address(market), 1);\n        nft.approve(address(market), 2);\n        market.listNFT(address(nft), 0, 1 ether);\n        market.listNFT(address(nft), 1, 1 ether);\n        market.listNFT(address(nft), 2, 1 ether);\n\n        vm.startPrank(user2);\n        deal(user2, 10 ether);\n        uint256 [] memory nfts = new uint256[] (3);\n        nfts[0] = 0;\n        nfts[1] = 1;\n        nfts[2] = 2; \n        market.buyMultipleNFT{value: 3 ether}(address(nft), nfts);     \n    }\n\n     function test_DelistingNFT() public {\n        vm.startPrank(user1);\n        nft.approve(address(market), 0);\n        market.listNFT(address(nft), 0, 1 ether);\n        assert(nft.ownerOf(0) == address(market));\n        market.delistNFT(address(nft), 0);\n        assert(nft.ownerOf(0) == address(user1));\n\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nThe test suite above ensures that the NTF marketplace contract operates as intended across its core functionalities.

The NFT is listed for one ether. The test ensures the <code>listNFT</code> the function works correctly, and the NFT is transferred to the marketplace.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Test buying a Single NFT</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nThe <code>test_BuyingNFT</code> function simulates the purchase of a listed NFT by <code>user2</code>, <code>user1</code> lists NFT tokenID0 for one ether, <code>user2</code> is funded with ten ether, and calls the <code>buyNFT</code> function, sending one ether to purchase the NFT. After the purchase, the owner of NFT tokenID0 is verified to be <code>user2</code>.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Test Buying Multiple NFTs</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nThe <code>test_BuyingMultipleNFT</code> function tests the ability to buy multiple NFTs in a single transaction, <code>user1</code> lists three NFTs with tokenIds (<code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>) for one ether each.</p>\n<p>\\\n<code>user2</code> calls the <code>buyMultipleNFT</code> function, passing the token IDs and sending three ether.</p>\n<p>The test ensures that <code>user2</code> it becomes the owner of all three NFTs and that the marketplace handles multiple purchases correctly.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Test Delisting an NFT</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nThe <code>test_DelistingNFT</code> the function verifies that <code>user1</code> they can delist their NFT from the marketplace. <code>user1</code> lists NFT tokenID0 for one ether and calls the <code>delistNFT</code> function. The NFT is returned to <code>user1</code> , and ownership of the NFT is confirmed to have reverted to <code>user1</code>.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>How to run Tests</strong></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<pre><code>forge test\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"deploymentandverificationonlinea\"><strong>Deployment and Verification on Linea</strong></h2>\n<p>Add the necessary variables to .env.

      "content": "MojoKid writes: Intel officially revealed its next generation discrete graphics cards, code named Battlemage, this morning. There are two midrange cards in the series so far, branded Arc B580 and Arc B570, though future higher-end B700 series cards are unknown currently. The graphics architecture for Battlemage is Xe2, and it debuted in the iGPU on Lunar Lake Core Ultra 200V mobile processors earlier this year. \n\nArc B580 is paired to 12GB of GDDR6 memory operating at an effective data rate of 19Gbps over a 192-bit interface, and its average GPU clock should hover around 2,670MHz. The Arc B570 is based on the same slice of silicon, but scales things down with 10GB of GDDR6 memory operating at the same speed as the B580, but connected over a narrower 160-bit interface. The B570's average GPU clock will also be lower, in the 2,500MHz range. Performance-wise, Intel is projecting that Arc B580 will be about 10% faster than an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 on average but will be priced at $249 USD, undercutting GeForce RTX 4060 substantially while offering 4GB more onboard graphics memory. Arc B580 cards are due to arrive in market this month, with Arc B570 arriving in January 2025 at $219 USD.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Intel+Debuts+Arc+Battlemage+Discrete+Graphics+Cards%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F03%2F1620246%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F03%2F1620246%2Fintel-debuts-arc-battlemage-discrete-graphics-cards%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://slashdot.org/story/24/12/03/1620246/intel-debuts-arc-battlemage-discrete-graphics-cards?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23540265&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

This act of defiance sheds light on alleged exploitative practices within OpenAI's early access program and offers a rare glimpse into the capabilities of the Sora model.</p>\n<h2 id=\"understandingsoraopenaistexttovideomodel\"><strong>Understanding Sora: OpenAI's Text-to-Video Model</strong></h2>\n<p>Sora is <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/sora/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">OpenAI</a>'s advanced text-to-video model designed to generate high-quality videos from textual descriptions. Building upon the technologies behind DALL·E and GPT models, Sora utilizes a recaptioning technique to produce videos that closely adhere to user prompts. The model is capable of creating complex scenes featuring multiple characters, specific motions, and detailed backgrounds, demonstrating an understanding of physical world dynamics.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theleakanditsimplications\"><strong>The Leak and Its Implications</strong></h2>\n<p>The leaked version of Sora allowed users to generate 1080p, 10-second video clips, reportedly at faster render times than previously disclosed. Notably, these clips bore OpenAI's watermark, indicating their origin. The temporary availability of Sora on Hugging Face lasted several hours before OpenAI intervened to shut down access.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/btibor91/status/1861433835528839632?embedable=true\">https://x.com/btibor91/status/1861433835528839632?embedable=true</a></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"artistsgrievancesunpaidlaborandstrictcontrols\"><strong>Artists' Grievances: Unpaid Labor and Strict Controls</strong></h2>\n<p>The protest group claims that OpenAI enlisted hundreds of artists for unpaid testing, maintaining strict control over all generated content and its dissemination. In an open letter accompanying the leak, the artists stated:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"We received access to Sora with the promise to be early testers, red teamers, and creative partners.

      "content": "<p>Speculative decoding is an advanced AI inference technique that is gaining traction in natural language processing (NLP) and other sequence generation tasks. It addresses one of the most significant challenges in deploying large-scale models: balancing computational efficiency with the quality of generated outputs. Models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 have set new benchmarks in AI capability but are computationally expensive, especially for real-time applications such as chatbots, translation systems, and interactive assistants. </p>\n<p>\\\nSpeculative decoding offers a clever solution by introducing a two-model system: a smaller, faster draft model and a larger, more accurate target model. This approach reduces latency without compromising the quality of the generated sequences. At its core, speculative decoding is a two-step process. First, a lightweight draft model generates a sequence of tokens quickly. This model is typically a distilled version of the target model or another smaller model trained for speed. The draft model's output is not final but serves as a proposal. </p>\n<p>\\\nThe second step involves the larger, more accurate target model, which evaluates the draft model’s tokens. The target model either accepts the proposed tokens if they meet a confidence threshold or refines them if they do not. This process allows the system to leverage the efficiency of the draft model while maintaining the precision of the target model. The reason speculative decoding is particularly appealing lies in its ability to reduce the computational burden of the larger model. By delegating the initial token generation to the draft model, the target model operates selectively, focusing only on validation or correction rather than generating every token from scratch. </p>\n<p>\\\nThis division of labor significantly reduces inference latency and resource consumption, making it a preferred technique for real-time applications. The technique works well in scenarios where speed is critical, and the quality of generated outputs cannot be compromised. For instance, in chat-based applications, users expect near-instantaneous responses. Speculative decoding ensures that the system generates text quickly while retaining the nuanced understanding of the larger model. Similarly, in real-time translation systems, where delays can disrupt communication, speculative decoding provides a practical way to meet latency constraints. To understand speculative decoding more concretely, let us consider a code implementation. Below is an example that demonstrates how speculative decoding could be implemented using PyTorch and Hugging Face's Transformers library. This implementation involves a draft model (a smaller, faster version like DistilGPT-2) and a target model (a larger, more accurate model like GPT-2).</p>\n<p>\\\n\\</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\n# Load the draft (smaller) and target (larger) models\n\ndraft_model_name = \"distilgpt2\"  # Smaller, faster model \n\ntarget_model_name = \"gpt2\"      # Larger, more accurate model\n\ndraft_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(draft_model_name) draft_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(draft_model_name)\n\ntarget_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(target_model_name) target_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(target_model_name)\n\ndef speculative_decode(prompt, max_length=50, threshold=0.9): \"\"\" Performs speculative decoding using a draft model and a target model.\n\nArgs:\n    prompt (str): The input text to the model.\n    max_length (int): The maximum length of the generated sequence.\n    threshold (float): The confidence threshold for the target model to accept tokens.\n\nReturns:\n    str: The generated text sequence.\n\"\"\"\n# Step 1: Generate tokens using the draft model\ndraft_inputs = draft_tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\")  # Tokenize the prompt\ndraft_outputs = draft_model.generate(draft_inputs.input_ids, max_length=max_length)  # Generate draft tokens\ndraft_tokens = draft_tokenizer.decode(draft_outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)  # Decode draft tokens to text\n\n# Step 2: Verify tokens using the target model\ntarget_inputs = target_tokenizer(draft_tokens, return_tensors=\"pt\")  # Tokenize the draft output for the target model\ntarget_logits = target_model(**target_inputs).logits  # Get logits (un-normalized probabilities) from the target model\n\n# Step 3: Calculate confidence scores for each token\nprobs = target_logits.softmax(dim=-1)  # Convert logits to probabilities\nconfidence = probs.max(dim=-1).values.mean().item()  # Calculate the average confidence score across all tokens\n\n# Step 4: Decide whether to accept or refine tokens\nif confidence &gt;= threshold:  # If confidence exceeds the threshold\n    return draft_tokens  # Accept the draft tokens\nelse:  # Otherwise, refine the sequence using the target model\n    refined_outputs = target_model.generate(target_inputs.input_ids, max_length=max_length)\n    return target_tokenizer.decode(refined_outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)  # Return the refined sequence\n\n\nprompt = \"The future of AI is\" output = speculative_decode(prompt, max_length=20) print(output)\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nIn this implementation, the speculative decoding process begins with the draft model generating a sequence of tokens. These tokens are then passed to the target model, which calculates the confidence for each token. If the average confidence exceeds a pre-defined threshold, the tokens are accepted as is. Otherwise, the target model refines the sequence to ensure output quality. This code includes detailed comments explaining each step, from tokenizing the input for the draft model to generating and validating tokens with the target model. The threshold parameter can be adjusted based on the application’s tolerance for speed versus accuracy trade-offs. One of the primary challenges in implementing speculative decoding is training the draft model. </p>\n<p>\\\nThe draft model must align closely with the target model in terms of predictions, as significant discrepancies can reduce the efficiency of the process. For example, if the draft model frequently proposes incorrect tokens, the target model spends more time correcting them, negating the benefits of speculative decoding. Ensuring this alignment typically involves fine-tuning or distillation techniques that transfer knowledge from the target model to the draft model. </p>\n<p>\\\nAnother critical aspect of speculative decoding is the confidence threshold used by the target model to accept or reject the draft model's tokens. If the threshold is too strict, the target model rejects too many tokens, increasing its workload and reducing efficiency. Conversely, if the threshold is too lenient, the system may accept suboptimal tokens, degrading output quality. Fine-tuning this parameter requires careful experimentation and may vary depending on the application. Speculative decoding can also integrate with parallel computation to further enhance efficiency. </p>\n<p>\\\nFor example, while the target model processes one batch of tokens, the draft model can begin generating the next batch. This overlap reduces idle time for both models and maximizes throughput, making speculative decoding scalable for high-volume systems. While challenges like draft-target alignment and confidence threshold tuning exist, ongoing advancements in model training and inference techniques promise to make speculative decoding even more robust and accessible. </p>\n<p>\\\nThis technique is poised to play a pivotal role in the future of AI deployment, particularly as demand for high-speed, high-quality systems continues to grow.

Yet, as dawn breaks, a critical question looms: Are our leaders truly serving our people's economic future?</p>\n<p>\\\nIn the corridors of power across our island nations, a profound disconnect exists. While the global economic landscape transforms at lightning speed, our leaders and their trusted advisors remain trapped in a time warp of economic thinking, blind to the revolutionary potential of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>\\\nLook around. The world is changing. Technological innovation is rewriting the rules of economic engagement, yet our leadership seems content to sit on the sidelines, clutching outdated economic playbooks. The United States, Russia, and China aren't just exploring cryptocurrency – they're actively integrating it into their economic strategies. But here in the Pacific? Silence. Inaction. For a region that needs it most, it's a profound failure of vision.</p>\n<p>\\\nSome of our islands made a pragmatic choice years ago by adopting foreign currencies – the Cook Islands, Niue, Tuvalu, Kiribati, Nauru, and the Federated States of Micronesia instead of printing weak national currencies as a futile exercise. Today, that same pragmatism demands we look beyond traditional financial systems.</p>\n<p>\\\nBitcoin isn't just a currency. It's a lifeline to economic sovereignty that our current leadership seems underhandedly ignorant about. While they, augmented by their advisors, spend countless hours in meetings, drafting complex reports that go nowhere, the world moves on. They debate, we stagnate.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe real wealth of our nations isn't in government offices or international aid proposals. It's in the minds of our young people, in the determination of our workers, in the entrepreneurial spirit that burns bright despite institutional barriers. Cryptocurrency offers them a path to economic freedom that our current leadership refuses to see.</p>\n<p>\\\nImagine a young entrepreneur in Tokelau or a small business owner in the Solomon Islands able to participate in the global economy without the suffocating bureaucracy of traditional banking. Imagine breaking free from financial systems that have never truly served our interests. This isn't a dream – it's a possibility that our leaders are systematically preventing.</p>\n<p>\\\nOur advisors pride themselves on their academic credentials and international connections. But credentials mean nothing if they can't see the economic revolution happening right in front of them. They're so busy protecting old systems that they're missing the future being built by every individual with a smartphone and a vision.</p>\n<p>\\\nWe own the world's largest oceanic resource. We have a strategic position that most nations would kill for. Yet our leadership treats this potential like a footnote, not a launching pad for true economic innovation. Bitcoin and blockchain technologies offer us a way to leverage our unique position on the global stage, but our leaders are too busy looking backward to see the opportunity.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo the leaders of the Pacific Islands: Your ignorance is not just a failure of imagination. It's a direct impediment to the economic progress of your people. Every day you hesitate is a day you're stealing opportunity from the next generation.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo the advisors who surround these leaders: Your job is to challenge, to innovate, to push boundaries. If you're not bringing cryptocurrency and blockchain solutions to the table, you're not doing your job. You're part of the problem.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe revolution is happening with or without you. Technology doesn't wait. Economic opportunity doesn't pause for bureaucratic indecision. The only question is whether our Pacific Island nations will lead or be left behind.</p>\n<p>\\\nRise up.

From a report: Amazon Web Services is partnering with startup Orbital Materials, which used artificial intelligence to create a new material specifically designed for separating carbon from hot air exhaust in data centers, the companies announced Monday. \n\nOrbital Materials CEO Jonathan Godwin said he expects AWS to capture enough carbon to exceed the fossil fuel consumption used to power its AI data centers, giving them a net negative impact on climate change. The process will cost less than purchasing captured carbon to offset its climate impact, according to Godwin. The system, part of a pilot program at a to-be-determined data center location, works when outside air is sucked in and used to cool extremely hot semiconductors designed to run or train powerful AI models, such as Anthropic's Claude chatbot.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Amazon+AI+Data+Centers+To+Double+as+Carbon+Capture+Machines%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F03%2F1635220%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F03%2F1635220%2Famazon-ai-data-centers-to-double-as-carbon-capture-machines%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://slashdot.org/story/24/12/03/1635220/amazon-ai-data-centers-to-double-as-carbon-capture-machines?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23540291&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

In a cooling job market, that's a lot easier said than done.&#194;From a report: White-collar hiring continues to slow, but workers' restlessness to find new work is intensifying, new Gallup data show. More than half of 20,000 U.S. workers surveyed in November said they were watching for or actively seeking a new job. That's the largest share since 2015, eclipsing the so-called Great Resignation of 2021 and 2022, when millions of people quit jobs for better ones. \n\nThe result? Job satisfaction has fallen to its lowest level in recent years as employees feel more stuck -- and frustrated -- where they are, according to Gallup, whose quarterly surveys are widely viewed as a bellwether of workplace sentiment. Smaller raises and fewer promotions are spurring some of the discontent, workers say. So are cost-cutting moves and stepped-up requirements to be working in offices more often.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=The+Number+of+Americans+Wanting+To+Switch+Jobs+Hits+a+10-Year+High%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F03%2F1853246%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F03%2F1853246%2Fthe-number-of-americans-wanting-to-switch-jobs-hits-a-10-year-high%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/03/1853246/the-number-of-americans-wanting-to-switch-jobs-hits-a-10-year-high?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23540435&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",
