TeaTime is riding that wave...<p>A couple of years ago I was intrigued by phiresky's post[0] about querying SQLite over HTTP. It made me think that if anyone can publish a database using GitHub Pages, I could probably build a frontend in which users can decide which database to query. TeaTime is like that - when you first visit it, you'll need to choose your database. Everyone can create additional databases[1]. TeaTime then queries it, and fetches files using an IPFS gateway (I'm looking into using Helia so that users are also contributing nodes in the network). Files are then rendered in the website itself. Everything is done in the browser - no users, no cookies, no tracking. LocalStorage and IndexedDB are used for saving your last readings, and your position in each file.<p>Since TeaTime is a static site, it's super easy (and free) to deploy. GitHub repo tags are used for maintaining a list of public instances[2].<p>Note that a GitHub repository isn't mandatory for storing the SQLite files or the front end - it's only for the configuration file (config.json) of each database, and for listing instances. Both the instances themselves and the database files can be hosted on Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, your Raspberry Pi, or any other server that can host static files.<p>I'm curious to see what other kinds of databases people can create, and what other types of files TeaTime could be used for.<p>[0] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27016630\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27016630</a><p>[1] <a href=\"https://github.com/bjesus/teatime-json-database/\">https://github.com/bjesus/teatime-json-database/</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://github.com/bjesus/teatime/wiki/Creating-a-TeaTime-instance\">https://github.com/bjesus/teatime/wiki/Creating-a-TeaTime-in...</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42256104\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42256104</a></p>\n<p>Points: 306</p>\n<p># Comments: 55</p>\n",

      "content": "\n<p>Hello HN! I am Aswin Mohan, full-stack mobile + web developer and I built PaperMoney(<a href=\"https://getpaper.money\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://getpaper.money</a>). PaperMoney is a double-entry accounting based personal finance app. It can help you keep track of your expenses, assets, liabilities and your net-worth. It is based on the command-line tools beancount and ledger.<p>I had been using beancount to track my expenses for over two years. The plain-text accounting and reporting with fava was great, but I wanted a mobile based app to keep track on the go. Looked around existing solutions but everything fell short when compared to beancount. Also the major apps were not available outside the United States and only supported the dollar. They were based on assigning categories to a list of transactions which I found lacking coming from double-entry accounting. So I created Paper Money. It's based on double-entry accounting, you can add your chart of accounts and add balanced transactions. We'll use this to calculate your net-worth and the balances in your accounts.<p>It's built using React Native for the frontend and Elixir and Phoenix on the backend. We have support for both Android and iOS. I have plans to add automated account syncing and automated expense tracking in future versions.<p>The target audience currently is someone who is familiar with double-entry accounting but looking for a hosted mobile version. The future versions will be focused on more mainstream customers of personal finance apps, which means making the app more accessible for people without prior experience with double-entry accounting.<p>I am available at aswin@getpaper.money if you have any questions or querires, and excited to hear your feedback!<p>Links:\nWebsite: <a href=\"https://getpaper.money\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://getpaper.money</a>\nIOS: <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/in/app/papermoney/id6737713983\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://apps.apple.com/in/app/papermoney/id6737713983</a>\nAndroid: <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.papermoney.app\">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.papermoney...</a><p>Video Demo of the App: <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/40cf50afe33f4e1cb4fa3e749c19a2e3?t=34\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.loom.com/share/40cf50afe33f4e1cb4fa3e749c19a2e3?...</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42256125\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42256125</a></p>\n<p>Points: 63</p>\n<p># Comments: 25</p>\n",

However, I could not find one that I could trust due to privacy concerns. Many of them upload the plaintext of videos to their servers and none is fully open-source as far as I know. Therefore, I decided to use my spare time to build one from scratch. Called Privastead (as in Private Homestead), it uses OpenMLS for end-to-end encryption (between the camera local hub and the smartphone) and is mostly implemented in Rust (except for part of the Android app that is implemented in Kotlin). The system is functional now and I've been using it in my own house for the past couple of weeks.<p>Based on some of the discussions I've seen online, it seems like there are other users who are also concerned with the privacy implications of home security cameras. Therefore, I decided to open source my solution for everyone to use. If you need a privacy-preserving home security camera, please give it a try and provide feedback. Note that trying out the system requires you to have a supported IP camera, a local machine connected to the IP camera, a server, and an Android smartphone. I have put together detailed instructions on setting up the system, which I hope makes it easier for others to get the system up and running.<p>In addition, consider contributing to the project. The prototype currently has a lot of limitations: mainly that it has only been tested with one IP camera, only allows the use of one camera, and only supports Android. I'll continue to improve the prototype as time permits, but progress will be much faster if there are other contributors as well.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42284412\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42284412</a></p>\n<p>Points: 527</p>\n<p># Comments: 160</p>\n",

Just look at how incredibly hard it is to make routing using LangGraph - conditional edges are a mess.<p>I built Laminar Flow to solve a common frustration with traditional workflow engines - the rigid need to predefine all node connections. Instead of static DAGs, Flow uses a dynamic task queue system that lets workflows evolve at runtime.<p>Flow is built on 3 core principles:<p>* Concurrent Execution - Tasks run in parallel automatically<p>* Dynamic Scheduling - Tasks can schedule new tasks at runtime<p>* Smart Dependencies - Tasks can await results from previous operations<p>All tasks share a thread-safe context for state management.<p>This architecture makes it surprisingly simple to implement complex patterns like map-reduce, streaming results, cycles, and self-modifying workflows. Perfect for AI agents that need to make runtime decisions about their next actions.<p>Flow is lightweight, elegantly written and has zero dependencies for the engine.<p>Behind the scenes it's a ThreadPoolExecutor, which is more than enough to handle concurrent execution considering majority of AI workflows are IO bound.<p>To make it possible to wait for the completion of previous tasks, I just added semaphore for the state value. Once the state is set, one permit is released for the semaphore.<p>The project also comes with built-in OpenTelemetry instrumentation for debugging and state reconstruction.<p>Give it a try here -> <a href=\"https://github.com/lmnr-ai/flow\">https://github.com/lmnr-ai/flow</a>. Just do pip install lmnr-flow. (or uv add lmnr-flow). More examples are in the readme.<p>Looking forward to feedback from the HN community!
