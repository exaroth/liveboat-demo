The idea of programming seemed exclusively reserved for those fluent in syntax and logic. However, the narrative is now being challenged by natural language coding being implemented in AI tools like GitHub Copilot. Andrej Karpathy, senior director of AI at Tesla predicted this trend last year.... English is emerging as the universal coding language. \n\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang believes that English is becoming a new programming language thanks to AI advancements. Speaking at the World Government Summit, Huang explained, \"It is our job to create computing technology such that nobody has to program and that the programming language is human\"... He calls this a \"miracle of AI,\" emphasising how it closes the technology divide and empowers people from all fields to become effective technologists without traditional coding skills... \"In the future, you will tell the computer what you want, and it will do it,\"&#226; Huang commented. Large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-4 and its successors have made this possible... \n\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella has been equally vocal about the potential of English for coding. Microsoft's GitHub Copilot, an AI code assistant, enables developers to describe their needs in natural language and receive functional code in response. Nadella describes this as part of a broader mission to \"empower every person and every organisation on the planet to achieve more\".... In a discussion earlier last year, Stability AI CEO Emad Mostaque claimed, \"41% of codes on GitHub are AI-generated\"... \n\nIn 2024, the ability to program is no longer reserved for a few. It's a skill anyone can wield, thanks to the power of natural language processing and AI\n \n\"No longer is the power to create software restricted to those who can decipher programming languages,\" the article concludes. \"Anyone with a problem to solve and a clear enough articulation of that problem can now write software.\" \n\nAlthough the article also includes this consoling quote from Nvidia's Huang in March. \"There is an artistry to prompt engineering. It's how you fine-tune the instructions to get exactly what you want\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Thanks+to+AI%2C+the+Hottest+New+Programming+Language+is...+English+%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F08%2F2154224%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F08%2F2154224%2Fthanks-to-ai-the-hottest-new-programming-language-is-english%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://developers.slashdot.org/story/24/12/08/2154224/thanks-to-ai-the-hottest-new-programming-language-is-english?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"The Theory and Technique of Electronic Music (2006)","url":"https://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques.htm","date":1733697971,"author":"ofalkaed","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques.htm\">https://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques.htm</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42361404\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42361404</a></p>\n<p>Points: 259</p>\n<p># Comments: 74</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Linux Kernel 6.12 Confirmed As LTS, Will Be Supported For 'Multiple Years'","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/24/12/09/0125219/linux-kernel-612-confirmed-as-lts-will-be-supported-for-multiple-years?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1733714400,"author":"EditorDavid","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Slashdot reader prisoninmate shared this report from the blog 9to5Linux\n\n\n\nRenowned Linux kernel developer Greg Kroah-Hartman announced Thursday that the Linux 6.12 kernel series has been officially marked as LTS (Long Term Support) on the kernel.org website with a predicted life expectancy of at least two years. \n\nLinux kernel 6.12 was released on November 17th, 2024, and introduces new features like real-time \"PREEMPT_RT\" support, a new scheduler called sched_ext, and DRM panic messages as QR codes, as well as numerous new and updated drivers for better hardware support... \n\nLinux kernel 6.12 joins the many other long-term support kernel branches, namely Linux 6.6 LTS, Linux 6.1 LTS, Linux 5.15 LTS, Linux 5.10 LTS, and Linux 5.4 LTS. Apart from the latter, the rest of them, including Linux kernel 6.12, will be officially supported until the end of December 2026. Hopefully, Linux kernel 6.12 will be supported for more than two years as the kernel maintainers usually aim for four years of support for a new LTS kernel, especially if there's demand from hardware manufacturers and other companies that aim to use a long-term supported kernel in their devices.\n<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\"

The issue resolved itself in a couple of minutes but to do a post-mortem we started investigating the cause in the morning. Long story short, we couldn’t find the cause that day. There was nothing special in the logs of the Rook Ceph pods and the only suspicious thing in the Grafana dashboard was a spike in the average OSD operation time. We called it a day and planned to continue the investigation tomorrow. However, the same incident happened during the night. Most importantly at the same time and got resolved by itself again. We turned our attention from the Rook Ceph to the particular nodes on which the OSDs weren’t responding. We saw quite intense CPU iowait in the Grafana but just as spikes in an average OSD operation time, it looked more like a symptom than a cause. So, that day we didn’t find the root cause either and went to sleep but when we woke up there was another surprise. The same incident with the Rook Ceph and again at the same time. At least this time the OSDs on only one of the nodes weren’t responding. So we took a deeper look into the metrics of this node and spotted a gap in the Grafana graphs (there should be the first image).<br/> We didn’t recognize these gaps in previous days because unless you don’t zoom in enough it looks like a constant rise finishing with a spike (there should be the second image).Anyway, from this point we knew that Prometheus didn’t get the data from this node at the time of the Rook Ceph incident, so we looked at the /var/log/syslog and saw an outage of the interface that is used to connect the affected node to the Kubernetes cluster.<br/> 2024-12-06T04:30:06.769443+01:00 rancher-production-node-9 kernel: bnxt_en 0000:c1:00.0 enp193s0f0np0: NIC Link is Down<br/> 2024-12-06T04:30:06.796676+01:00 rancher-production-node-9 systemd-networkd[1358015]: enp193s0f0np0: Lost carrier<br/> 2024-12-06T04:30:06.805420+01:00 rancher-production-node-9 systemd-networkd[1358015]: enp193s0f0np0: DHCPv6 lease lost<br/> 2024-12-06T04:30:06.806466+01:00 rancher-production-node-9 systemd-timesyncd[1358005]: No network connectivity, watching for changes.2024-12-06T04:42:36.080426+01:00 rancher-production-node-9 kernel: bnxt_en 0000:c1:00.0 enp193s0f0np0: NIC Link is Up, 1000 Mbps full duplex, Flow control: none<br/> 2024-12-06T04:42:36.080447+01:00 rancher-production-node-9 kernel: bnxt_en 0000:c1:00.0 enp193s0f0np0: FEC autoneg off encoding: None<br/> 2024-12-06T04:42:36.081696+01:00 rancher-production-node-9 systemd-networkd[1358015]: enp193s0f0np0: Gained carrier<br/> Eventually, we found out that this was the root cause of every Rook Ceph incident we experienced for the last few days and it happened due to the Hetzner incidents.<br/> How many of you spend an unreasonable amount of time searching for the root cause of an incident in a bad place?

Because sometimes you just want a simple message queue that: - Works exactly like SQS (you can use existing SDKs, or use it as a local mock SQS for testing) - Doesn&#39;t need a whole cluster setup - Actually persists your data (sorry Redis) - Is stupid simple to deploy (it&#39;s just one binary)</p> <p>I also just thought it would be fun to build. I may have come up with the other &quot;why&quot;s after the fact.</p> <p>The cool stuff: - Multi-tenant support with namespaces - Built-in auth system - bearer-based auth or AWS SIGv4 - Admin UI for managing everything (+ an admin API) - Apache 2.0 licensed</p> <p>Future plans: - DB-per-queue for higher throughput - High availability via replication and raft consensus</p> <p>It&#39;s still early days but the core functionality is there.

Some time ago I realized that some architectures potentially much superior to the classic VonNeumann, have been forgotten because there were no reliable technical solutions to implement them.\nOne of these architectures particularly struck me and it is the \"Dataflow architecture\", in which there is no Program counter, but the instructions are executed in real contemporaneity whenever the operands are available.\nIn trying to find a technical solution that implements this type of architecture effectively (spoiler: yes, maybe I succeeded but I still have to test the real correct functioning!) I realized that this solution works more than well with three logical states. And at this point I discovered that perhaps it is better to implement a CPU with three states (ternary) instead of a white one. This as a first step to realize my dataflow solution.\nObviously a world has opened up to me regarding ternary CPUs, I have discovered not only that they are the best solution implemented for a computing device, but also that an increasing number of university and researcher papers are dealing with them in recent times.\nThis is also thanks to the enormous potential compared to normal CPUs; lower circuit complexity (and also lower consumption and lower heat production) but at the same time the truly formidable information representation capabilities compared to binary counterparts!\nSo here I am creating this ternary CPU and all the hardware and software to be able to use it immediately.

So when ARM instances became commonly available on one of our providers, seemingly providing great performance at a lower cost, we had to take a closer look! In this talk, we will first describe the steps we took to make our clusters ARM-ready and a few interesting issues we encountered during our initial tests: from performance regressions due to compiler behaviors to subtle memory corruption bugs. We will then discuss new challenges, in particular how to achieve load-balancing and auto-scaling when running workloads on a mix of CPUs with different performances, and share our results.
