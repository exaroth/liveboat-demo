The idea of programming seemed exclusively reserved for those fluent in syntax and logic. However, the narrative is now being challenged by natural language coding being implemented in AI tools like GitHub Copilot. Andrej Karpathy, senior director of AI at Tesla predicted this trend last year.... English is emerging as the universal coding language. \n\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang believes that English is becoming a new programming language thanks to AI advancements. Speaking at the World Government Summit, Huang explained, \"It is our job to create computing technology such that nobody has to program and that the programming language is human\"... He calls this a \"miracle of AI,\" emphasising how it closes the technology divide and empowers people from all fields to become effective technologists without traditional coding skills... \"In the future, you will tell the computer what you want, and it will do it,\"&#226; Huang commented. Large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-4 and its successors have made this possible... \n\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella has been equally vocal about the potential of English for coding. Microsoft's GitHub Copilot, an AI code assistant, enables developers to describe their needs in natural language and receive functional code in response. Nadella describes this as part of a broader mission to \"empower every person and every organisation on the planet to achieve more\".... In a discussion earlier last year, Stability AI CEO Emad Mostaque claimed, \"41% of codes on GitHub are AI-generated\"... \n\nIn 2024, the ability to program is no longer reserved for a few. It's a skill anyone can wield, thanks to the power of natural language processing and AI\n \n\"No longer is the power to create software restricted to those who can decipher programming languages,\" the article concludes. \"Anyone with a problem to solve and a clear enough articulation of that problem can now write software.\" \n\nAlthough the article also includes this consoling quote from Nvidia's Huang in March. \"There is an artistry to prompt engineering. It's how you fine-tune the instructions to get exactly what you want\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Thanks+to+AI%2C+the+Hottest+New+Programming+Language+is...+English+%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F08%2F2154224%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F08%2F2154224%2Fthanks-to-ai-the-hottest-new-programming-language-is-english%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://developers.slashdot.org/story/24/12/08/2154224/thanks-to-ai-the-hottest-new-programming-language-is-english?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"The Theory and Technique of Electronic Music (2006)","url":"https://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques.htm","date":1733697971,"author":"ofalkaed","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques.htm\">https://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques.htm</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42361404\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42361404</a></p>\n<p>Points: 276</p>\n<p># Comments: 77</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Linux Kernel 6.12 Confirmed As LTS, Will Be Supported For 'Multiple Years'","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/24/12/09/0125219/linux-kernel-612-confirmed-as-lts-will-be-supported-for-multiple-years?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1733714400,"author":"EditorDavid","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Slashdot reader prisoninmate shared this report from the blog 9to5Linux\n\n\n\nRenowned Linux kernel developer Greg Kroah-Hartman announced Thursday that the Linux 6.12 kernel series has been officially marked as LTS (Long Term Support) on the kernel.org website with a predicted life expectancy of at least two years. \n\nLinux kernel 6.12 was released on November 17th, 2024, and introduces new features like real-time \"PREEMPT_RT\" support, a new scheduler called sched_ext, and DRM panic messages as QR codes, as well as numerous new and updated drivers for better hardware support... \n\nLinux kernel 6.12 joins the many other long-term support kernel branches, namely Linux 6.6 LTS, Linux 6.1 LTS, Linux 5.15 LTS, Linux 5.10 LTS, and Linux 5.4 LTS. Apart from the latter, the rest of them, including Linux kernel 6.12, will be officially supported until the end of December 2026. Hopefully, Linux kernel 6.12 will be supported for more than two years as the kernel maintainers usually aim for four years of support for a new LTS kernel, especially if there's demand from hardware manufacturers and other companies that aim to use a long-term supported kernel in their devices.\n<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\"

Some time ago I realized that some architectures potentially much superior to the classic VonNeumann, have been forgotten because there were no reliable technical solutions to implement them.\nOne of these architectures particularly struck me and it is the \"Dataflow architecture\", in which there is no Program counter, but the instructions are executed in real contemporaneity whenever the operands are available.\nIn trying to find a technical solution that implements this type of architecture effectively (spoiler: yes, maybe I succeeded but I still have to test the real correct functioning!) I realized that this solution works more than well with three logical states. And at this point I discovered that perhaps it is better to implement a CPU with three states (ternary) instead of a white one. This as a first step to realize my dataflow solution.\nObviously a world has opened up to me regarding ternary CPUs, I have discovered not only that they are the best solution implemented for a computing device, but also that an increasing number of university and researcher papers are dealing with them in recent times.\nThis is also thanks to the enormous potential compared to normal CPUs; lower circuit complexity (and also lower consumption and lower heat production) but at the same time the truly formidable information representation capabilities compared to binary counterparts!\nSo here I am creating this ternary CPU and all the hardware and software to be able to use it immediately.

So when ARM instances became commonly available on one of our providers, seemingly providing great performance at a lower cost, we had to take a closer look! In this talk, we will first describe the steps we took to make our clusters ARM-ready and a few interesting issues we encountered during our initial tests: from performance regressions due to compiler behaviors to subtle memory corruption bugs. We will then discuss new challenges, in particular how to achieve load-balancing and auto-scaling when running workloads on a mix of CPUs with different performances, and share our results. If migrating real workloads to ARM proved challenging, it was worth the effort and we now run more than 50% of our workloads on ARM.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/hD5lXEgp9Tg?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"After reading about the KubeCon keynotes, how do you think we can address the challenges of governance as tech gets more complicated?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hb0652/after_reading_about_the_kubecon_keynotes_how_do/","date":1733832002,"author":"/u/AnnualRich5252","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The keynotes from KubeCon this year really dive into the challenges of governance in tech.

You can use tools like Flake8, PyLint or Ruff to lint your code. You might use Mypy to verify type checking. There are lots of other tools at your disposal. But it can be hard to remember to do that every time you want to create a pull request (PR) in GitHub or GitLab.</p>\n<p>That is where continuous integration (CI) tools come in. GitHub has something called GitHub Actions that allow you to run tools or entire workflows on certain types of events.</p>\n<p>In this article, you will learn how to create a <a href=\"https://github.com/features/actions\">GitHub Action</a> that runs Ruff on a PR. You can learn more about Ruff in my <a href=\"https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2023/06/28/an-intro-to-ruff-an-extremely-fast-python-linter/\">introductory article</a>.</p>\n<h2>Creating a Workflow</h2>\n<p>In the root folder of your code, you will need to create a folder called <strong>.github/workflows</strong>. Note the period at the beginning and the fact that you need a subfolder named <strong>workflows</strong> too. Inside of that, you will create a YAML file.</p>\n<p>Since you are going to run Ruff to lint and format your Python files, you can call this YAML file <strong>ruff.yml. </strong>Put the following in your new file:</p>\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"yaml\">name: Ruff\non: [workflow_dispatch, pull_request]\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n      - name: Install Python\n        uses: actions/setup-python@v4\n        with:\n          python-version: \"3.13\"\n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: |\n          python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n          pip install ruff\n      # Include `--format=github` to enable automatic inline annotations.\n      - name: Run Ruff\n        run: ruff check --output-format=github .\n        continue-on-error: false\n      - name: Run Ruff format\n        run: ruff format --check .\n        continue-on-error: false</pre>\n<p>Note: This example comes from my <a href=\"https://github.com/driscollis/textual-cogs/blob/main/.github/workflows/ruff.yml\">textual-cogs repo</a></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about what this does. This line is pretty important:</p>\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"generic\">on: [workflow_dispatch, pull_request]</pre>\n<p>It tells GitHub to run this workflow when there&#8217;s a pull request and also with &#8220;workflow_dispatch&#8221;. That second option lets you go to the <strong>Actions</strong> tab in your GitHub repo, select the workflow and run it manually. If you do not include that, you cannot run it manually at all. This is useful for testing purposes, but you can remove it if you do not need it.</p>\n<p>The next part tells GitHub to run the build on ubuntu-linux:</p>\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"yaml\">jobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest</pre>\n<p>If you have a GitHub subscription, you can also get Windows as a runner, which means that you can also run these actions on Windows in addition to Linux.</p>\n<p>The steps section is the meat of this particular workflow:</p>\n<pre class=\"EnlighterJSRAW\" data-enlighter-language=\"yaml\">steps:\n  - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n  - name: Install Python\n    uses: actions/setup-python@v4\n    with:\n      python-version: \"3.13\"\n  - name: Install dependencies\n    run: |\n      python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n      pip install ruff\n  # Include `--format=github` to enable automatic inline annotations.\n  - name: Run Ruff\n    run: ruff check --output-format=github .\n    continue-on-error: false\n  - name: Run Ruff format\n    run: ruff format --check .\n    continue-on-error: false</pre>\n<p>Here is uses a built-in <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/checkout\">checkout@v4 workflow</a>, which is something that comes with GitHub. There are many others you can use to enhance your workflows and add new functionality. Next, you get setup with Python 3.13 and then you install your dependencies.</p>\n<p>Once your dependencies are installed, you can run your tools. In this case, you are installing and running Ruff. For every PR, you run <code>ruff check --output-format=github .</code>, which will do all sorts of linting on your Python code. If any errors are found, it will add inline comments with the error, which is what that <code>--output-format</code> flag is for.</p>\n<p>You also have a separate section to run Ruff format, which will format your code to follow the <a href=\"https://github.com/psf/black\">Black</a> formatter (for the most part).</p>\n<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>\n<p>You can add lots of other tools to your workflows too. For example, you might add a Mypy workflow, or some test workflows to run on PR or perhaps before merging to your main branch. You might even want to check your <a href=\"https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2023/09/20/learning-about-code-metrics-in-python-with-radon/\">code complexity</a> before allowing a merge too!</p>\n<p>With a little work, you will soon be able to use GitHub Actions to keep your code cleaner and make it more uniform too. Adding automated testing is even better! Give it a try and let me know what you think.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2024/12/10/checking-python-code-with-github-actions/\">Checking Python Code with GitHub Actions</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org\">Mouse Vs Python</a>.</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Launch HN: Double (YC W24) – Index Investing with 0% Expense Ratios","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42377018","date":1733840214,"author":"jjmaxwell4","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"\n<p>Hi HN, we’re JJ and Mark, the founders of Double (<a href=\"https://double.finance\">https://double.finance</a>). Double lets you invest in 50+ broad stock market indexes with 0% expense ratios. We handle all the management, including rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting—proactively selling losing stocks to potentially save on taxes—for $1/month.<p>Our goal is to bring the low fee trend pioneered by Robinhood to ETFs and mutual funds. We posted a Show HN about 3 months ago (<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41246686\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41246686</a>) and since then have crossed $10M in AUM (Assets Under Management) [1].<p>Here’s a demo video: <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/10c9150ce4114f278e8c249f211e7ec8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.loom.com/share/10c9150ce4114f278e8c249f211e7ec8</a>. Please note that none of this content should be treated as financial advice.<p>Everyone knows that fees eat into your investing returns. Financial advisors generally charge 1% of AUM per year, and ETFs have a weighted average expense ratio of about 0.17%, although some go as low as 0.03% for VOO. Over a 30-year period on a $500k portfolio, the money lost to those fees would be $1.30M for the financial advisor and $244k for the average ETF and even $42,951 for the low fee VOO.<p>Double lets you index invest without paying any percentage-based fees - we charge just $1/month. It works by buying the individual stocks that make up popular indexes. By buying the individual positions, we can also customize and tax-loss harvest your account, something ETFs or Mutual Funds cannot do.<p>Most ETFs and mutual funds today are not that complicated - they can be expressed as a CSV file with 2 columns - a ticker and a share number. You can find these holding csv files on most ETF pages (VOO[2], QQQ[3]). Right now there are about $9.1T of assets in ETFs[4] and $20T in Mutual Funds[5] in the US, with estimated revenue of $100B per year. We think this market is ripe for disruption.<p>We offer 50+ strategies that track popular ETFs and are updated as stocks merge and indexes change. You can customize these by weighting sectors or stocks differently, or even build your own indexes from scratch using our stock/etf screening tools. Once you've chosen your strategy, simply set your target weights and deposit funds (we also support transferring existing stocks). Our engine then checks your portfolio daily for potential trades, optimizes for tax-loss harvesting, portfolio tracking, and redeploys any generated cash.<p>I (JJ) started working on this after selling my last company. After using nearly every brokerage product out there and working with a financial advisor, I noticed a huge gap between the indexing capabilities of financial advisors and what individual investors could access. We wanted to bridge that gap and provide these powerful tools to everyone in a simple, low-cost way.<p>There are a number of robo-advisor products out there, but none that we know of offer direct indexing without expense ratios or AUM fees. One similar product is M1 Finance, but Double is more powerful. We offer tax-loss harvesting, a wider range of indexes, and greater customization. For example, when building your own index, you can set weights down to 0.1% (compared to M1's 1%) and even weight by market cap.<p>We also compete with robo-advisors like Wealthfront, but offer more control over your investments. And did I mention we don't charge AUM fees? You can see our strategies and play with the research page <a href=\"https://double.finance/p/explore\">https://double.finance/p/explore</a> without creating an account.<p>Over the past year we’ve learned a lot about the guts of building portfolio software. For example, stocks don’t really have persistent identifiers that are easy to model and pass around. We trade CUSIPs with our custodian Apex, but these change all the time for stock splits or re-org’s that you would not think would lead to a new “stock”.<p>We’ve also learned a lot about how tax loss harvesting (TLH) is best implemented on large direct index portfolios using a factor model as opposed to pairs based replacements which I initially thought might be the way to execute these. We do use a pairs strategy on smaller sized strategies. And how TLH and portfolio optimization generally is best expressed as a linear optimization problem with competing objectives (tracking vs. tax alpha vs. trading costs for example).<p>If you have any thoughts on the product or our positioning as the low fee alternative I’d love to hear it. I think Robinhood has proved that you can build a strong business by getting rid of an industry wide cost (in their case commissions, in our expense ratios). We aim to do the same.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/pro/fintech-deals/2024/12/10/direct-indexing-platform-double-finance-raises-seed?utm_source=editorial&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=pro_edit_regwall_01-24&utm_term=regwall\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.axios.com/pro/fintech-deals/2024/12/10/direct-in...</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/voo#portfolio-composition\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profi...</a>\n[3] <a href=\"https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/about.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/about.html</a>\n[4] <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1LM564090005Q\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1LM564090005Q</a>\n[5] <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1LM654090000Q\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1LM654090000Q</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42377018\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42377018</a></p>\n<p>Points: 153</p>\n<p># Comments: 147</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Designing Data Products: next steps","url":"https://martinfowler.com/articles/designing-data-products.html#HowBigShouldDataProductsBe","date":1733840520,"author":"Martin Fowler","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"\n<div class = 'img-link'><a href = 'https://martinfowler.com/articles/designing-data-products.html#HowBigShouldDataProductsBe'><img src = 'https://martinfowler.com/articles/designing-data-products/card.png#HowBigShouldDataProductsBe' width = '350px'></img></a></div>\n\n<p>Once we've designed our initial data products, <b class = 'author'>Kiran\n       Prakash</b> finishes his article by leading us through <a href = 'https://martinfowler.com/articles/designing-data-products.html#HowBigShouldDataProductsBe'>the\n       next steps</a>: identifying common patterns, improving the developer\n       experience, and handling governance.</p>\n\n<p><a class = 'more' href = 'https://martinfowler.com/articles/designing-data-products.html#HowBigShouldDataProductsBe'>more…</a></p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Rust Try Catch - Reinventing the nightmare!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hb32ca/rust_try_catch_reinventing_the_nightmare/","date":1733841180,"author":"/u/vrtgs-main","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"&#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/vrtgs-main\"> /u/vrtgs-main </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/rust-try-catch\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1hb32ca/rust_try_catch_reinventing_the_nightmare/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Exploring multi-tenancy for my Kubernetes learning platform","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hb3qhg/exploring_multitenancy_for_my_kubernetes_learning/","date":1733843005,"author":"/u/danielepolencic","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Stefan Roman</strong> shares his experience building <strong>Labs4Grabs</strong>, a platform that gives students root access to Kubernetes clusters.
