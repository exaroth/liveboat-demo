Watch it, but don&apos;t stop there - read the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_of_Your_Life?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Story of Your Life</a> novella it was based on for so much additional nuance.)</p><p>This is called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Fermi paradox</a>: </p><blockquote>The Fermi Paradox is a contradiction between high estimates of the probability of the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations, such as in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the Drake equation</a>, and lack of any evidence for such civilizations.<br><br>- There are billions of stars in the galaxy that are similar to the Sun including many billions of years older than Earth.<br>- With high probability, some of these stars will have Earth-like planets, and if the Earth is typical, some might develop intelligent life.<br>- Some of these civilizations might develop interstellar travel, a step the Earth is investigating now.<br>- Even at the slow pace of currently envisioned interstellar travel, the Milky Way galaxy could be completely traversed in about a million years.<br><br>According to this line of thinking,&#xA0;<strong>the Earth should have already been visited by extraterrestrial aliens</strong>. In an informal conversation, Fermi noted no convincing evidence of this, nor any signs of alien intelligence anywhere in the observable universe, leading him to ask, &#x201C;Where is everybody?&#x201D;</blockquote><p>To me, this is a compelling argument, in the same way that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel?ref=blog.codinghorror.com#Absence_of_time_travelers_from_the_future\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the lack of evidence of any time travellers</a> is:</p><blockquote>Many have argued that the absence of time travelers from the future demonstrates that such technology will never be developed, suggesting that it is impossible. This is analogous to the Fermi paradox related to the absence of evidence of extraterrestrial life. As the absence of extraterrestrial visitors does not categorically prove they do not exist, so the absence of time travelers fails to prove time travel is physically impossible; it might be that time travel is physically possible but is never developed or is cautiously used. Carl Sagan once suggested the possibility that time travelers could be here but are disguising their existence or are not recognized as time travelers.</blockquote><p>It seems, to me at least, clear evidence that time travel is not possible, given the enormous amount of time behind us. Something, somewhere, would certainly have invented it by now... right?</p><p>So if not, what happened? <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">The Great Filter</a>&#xA0;maybe?</p><blockquote>The Great Filter theory says that at some point from pre-life to Type III intelligence, there&#x2019;s a wall that all or nearly all attempts at life hit. There&#x2019;s some stage in that long evolutionary process that is extremely unlikely or impossible for life to get beyond.

Mostly I wanted to share <strong>my personal theory of why we haven&apos;t encountered alien life by now</strong>. Like computers themselves, things don&apos;t get larger. They get <em>smaller</em>. And <em>faster</em>. And so does intelligent life. </p><blockquote>Why build planet-size anything when the real action is in the small things? Small spaces, small units of time, <strong>everything gets smaller</strong>.</blockquote><p>Large is inefficient and unnecessary. Look at the history of computers: from giant to tiny and tinier. From slow to fast and faster. Personally, I have a feeling really advanced life eventually does away with all physical stuff that slows you down as soon as they can, and enters <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-infinite-space-between-words/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the infinite spaces between</a>:</p><blockquote>This is, of course, a variant on the Fermi paradox: We don&#x2019;t see clues to widespread, large-scale engineering, and consequently we must conclude that we&#x2019;re alone. But the possibly flawed assumption here is when we say that highly visible construction projects are an inevitable outcome of intelligence.&#xA0;<strong>It could be that it&#x2019;s the engineering of the small, rather than the large, that is inevitable.</strong>&#xA0;This follows from the laws of inertia (smaller machines are faster, and require less energy to function) as well as the speed of light (small computers have faster internal communication). It may be &#x2013; and this is, of course, speculation &#x2013; that advanced societies are building small technology and have little incentive or need to rearrange the stars in their neighborhoods, for instance. They may prefer to build nanobots instead.<br><br>&#x2014; <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040604012520/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/tech/nextnews/archive/next031104.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Seth Shostak</a></blockquote><p>Seth delivers an excellent TED talk on this topic as well:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe src=\"https://embed.ted.com/talks/seth_shostak_et_is_probably_out_there_get_ready\" width=\"560\" height=\"316\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>If we can <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">barely see far in the universe as is</a>, there&apos;s no way we could possibly see into the infinite space and time between.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dJTU48_yghs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"Her Official Trailer #1 (2013) - Joaquin Phoenix, Scarlett Johansson Movie HD\"></iframe></figure><p>That is of course just my opinion, but <a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/her?ref=blog.codinghorror.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">we&apos;ll see</a>.. eventually.</p>",

      "content": "\n<p>I think graph is a wrong abstraction for building AI agents. Just look at how incredibly hard it is to make routing using LangGraph - conditional edges are a mess.<p>I built Laminar Flow to solve a common frustration with traditional workflow engines - the rigid need to predefine all node connections. Instead of static DAGs, Flow uses a dynamic task queue system that lets workflows evolve at runtime.<p>Flow is built on 3 core principles:<p>* Concurrent Execution - Tasks run in parallel automatically<p>* Dynamic Scheduling - Tasks can schedule new tasks at runtime<p>* Smart Dependencies - Tasks can await results from previous operations<p>All tasks share a thread-safe context for state management.<p>This architecture makes it surprisingly simple to implement complex patterns like map-reduce, streaming results, cycles, and self-modifying workflows. Perfect for AI agents that need to make runtime decisions about their next actions.<p>Flow is lightweight, elegantly written and has zero dependencies for the engine.<p>Behind the scenes it's a ThreadPoolExecutor, which is more than enough to handle concurrent execution considering majority of AI workflows are IO bound.<p>To make it possible to wait for the completion of previous tasks, I just added semaphore for the state value. Once the state is set, one permit is released for the semaphore.<p>The project also comes with built-in OpenTelemetry instrumentation for debugging and state reconstruction.<p>Give it a try here -> <a href=\"https://github.com/lmnr-ai/flow\">https://github.com/lmnr-ai/flow</a>. Just do pip install lmnr-flow. (or uv add lmnr-flow). More examples are in the readme.<p>Looking forward to feedback from the HN community! Especially interested in hearing about your use cases for dynamic workflows.<p>Couple of things on the roadmap, so contributions are welcome!<p>* Async function support<p>* TS port<p>* Some consensus on how to handle task ids when the same tasks is spawned multiple times</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42299098\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42299098</a></p>\n<p>Points: 146</p>\n<p># Comments: 47</p>\n",

This was hard for me to figure out as it was a language misconception for me. I am relatively new in Go.</p> <p>Consider this example with a struct and slice of this struct struct:</p> <pre><code>type MyStruct struct { identifier int64 content []int } mySlice := make([]MyStruct, 0) // here, added some elements to `mySlice` </code></pre> <p>later, when interacting with this using a range based for loop such as:</p> <pre><code>for _, elem := range mySlice { elem.content = append(elem.content, 10) } </code></pre> <p>Why is this not modifying the original <code>elem.content</code> ? Since slices are &quot;reference types&quot;, i was expecting this to modify the original slice. I understand that normally range based for loops create copies, but I am confused as to why <code>elem</code> is a deep copy and not a shallow copy(?). This was totally unexpected for me.</p> <p>I guess my confusion also stems from the fact that when I assign one struct to another struct, the primitive variables are deep copied, but if there are any slice variables within the struct, they are shallow copied (slice descriptors are copied). I had another bug related to this in my code so I had to write a custom copier myself that does the deep copying work. I am confused because assignment seems to be different in behavior (i.e., does shallow copy) than this range based for loop behavior (i.e., does deep copy?).

The situation is this:</p> <ul> <li>It&#39;s going to be disconnected from the internet.</li> <li>There&#39;s a central SCADA server running Proxmox for specific VMs. One is a Kubernetes master VM to control the workers (if that&#39;s how it works).</li> <li>There&#39;s gonna be hundreds of micro industrial computers (MIC) running any Linux distro of our choice for Kubernetes workers. Each MIC has access to a closed network to read data from sensors, devices and other PLCs using our containerized software. It&#39;s made this way because our client requires store and forward in case of loss of communication between the local MIC and the SCADA server.</li> <li>There&#39;s a fixed number of MICs running on site, there won&#39;t be a need to autoscale those since the tasks each MIC has to do don&#39;t depend on how many clients are connected at once. That&#39;ll depend on the central SCADA server, which is already capable of handling thousands of clients, which is much more than enough.</li> <li>Not every MIC has to use the same software.

Learn more at https://kubecon.io\n\nObject, Block, or File Storage? Choosing the Right Cloud Storage to Integrate Into Kubernetes - Mitch Becker & Tom McDonald, Amazon Web Services (AWS)\n\nThis presentation helps simplify the container storage landscape to assist K8s users make educated cloud storage choices based on their workload requirements and data strategy. You already know K8s is a an open-source platform that orchestrates containerized applications. But what type of cloud storage should one deploy for stateless and stateful applications to ensure persistent data across various operational scenarios? Different storage types cater to specific use cases within K8s environments. Organizations often require persistent storage to run K8s for stateful use cases such as Large-Scale Application Deployment, High-Performance Computing (HPC), AI/ML, Microservices Management, CI/CD Pipelines, and Big Data Processing. Because Block, File, and Object Storage are used in varying ways for containerized workloads, this talk will explain use cases for each storage type and educate the attendees so their selection of storage supports their applications and overall data strategy.",

In case anyone here is thinking about implementing authorization in your Go lang apps - I wanted to share our OSS solution - Cerbos PDP. </p> <p>(We just hit 3k+ stars) <a href=\"https://github.com/cerbos/cerbos\">https://github.com/cerbos/cerbos</a> and here’s our SDK + guide for implementing authorization in Go <a href=\"https://www.cerbos.dev/ecosystem/go\">https://www.cerbos.dev/ecosystem/go</a> </p> <p><strong>Here are some of Cerbos PDP’s key capabilities and updates:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Infinitely scalable RBAC and ABAC.</strong> Users can author role-based or attributed-based access control policies. As well as define an unlimited number of roles, user permissions, and access control policies without affecting performance.</li> <li><strong>Decoupled authorization decision point</strong> that extracts complex access control logic into centrally managed and versioned policies. Cerbos also provides a framework to comprehensively test and deploy policies. It reduces code complexity, bugs, security vulnerabilities, and multiple if/then/else conditions.</li> <li><strong>A plug-and-play &amp; language-agnostic</strong> solution that works with any authentication/identity provider (Okta/Auth0, Active Directory, Entra ID, etc.) and seamlessly integrates into your existing infrastructure. </li> <li><strong>Authorize anywhere</strong>. Cerbos’ stateless design enables it to be run anywhere in your own infrastructure: in the cloud, across clouds, on-premise, at the edge, or directly on end user devices. Cerbos is optimized for sub-millisecond evaluation without having to synchronize data.</li> <li><strong>Centralized audit logs of all authorization requests</strong> help compliance with ISO27001, SOC2, and HIPAA requirements through real-time change logs for auditing access controls. </li> </ul> <p>PS. We just added an update that I think you’ll find valuable - The Cerbos server and the cerbosctl utility can now be installed on Nix environments using the new flake, and Go developers can now run Cerbos in-process using the new cerbos.Serve function from v0.39.0. This is useful for cases where running an external process is impossible or for running tests</p> <p>Let me know what you think, if you have a moment.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/morphAB\"> /u/morphAB </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1h5v36y/cerbos_pdp_open_source_authorization_solution_sdk/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1h5v36y/cerbos_pdp_open_source_authorization_solution_sdk/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I wanted to share our <strong>open source authorization solution - Cerbos PDP</strong> here, since it can be <strong>deployed in Kubernetes</strong> (guide and docs <a href=\"https://www.cerbos.dev/ecosystem/kubernetes\">https://www.cerbos.dev/ecosystem/kubernetes</a> ) and might be relevant if you’re looking to implement authorization in your applications.Here’s our repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/cerbos/cerbos\">https://github.com/cerbos/cerbos</a> (we just hit 3333+ stars).<strong>Here are some of Cerbos PDP’s key capabilities:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Infinitely scalable RBAC and ABAC.</strong> Users can author role-based or attributed-based access control policies. As well as define an unlimited number of roles, user permissions, and access control policies without affecting performance.</li> <li><strong>Decoupled authorization decision point</strong> that extracts complex access control logic into centrally managed and versioned policies. Cerbos also provides a framework to comprehensively test and deploy policies. It reduces code complexity, bugs, security vulnerabilities, and multiple if/then/else conditions.</li> <li><strong>A plug-and-play &amp; language-agnostic</strong> solution that works with any authentication/identity provider (Okta/Auth0, Active Directory, Entra ID, etc.) and seamlessly integrates into your existing infrastructure. Comes with SDKs for <a href=\"https://www.cerbos.dev/features-benefits-and-use-cases/ecosystem\">all popular languages</a>, and example implementations in modern frameworks.</li> <li><strong>Authorize anywhere</strong>. Cerbos’ stateless design enables it to be run anywhere in your own infrastructure: in the cloud, across clouds, on-premise, at the edge, or directly on end user devices. Cerbos is optimized for sub-millisecond evaluation without having to synchronize data.</li> <li><strong>Centralized audit logs of all authorization requests</strong> help compliance with ISO27001, SOC2, and HIPAA requirements through real-time change logs for auditing access controls.</li> </ul> <p>Please let me know if you have any feedback.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/diggVSredditt\"> /u/diggVSredditt </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1h5vkev/cerbos_pdp_open_source_rbac_abac_how_to_deploy_in/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1h5vkev/cerbos_pdp_open_source_rbac_abac_how_to_deploy_in/\">[comments]</a></span>",
