This is the kind\nof file that you can just <code>&lt;script src&gt;</code> and it&rsquo;ll Just Work. Great if you\ncan get it but not always available</li>\n<li>an ES module (which may or may not depend on other files, we&rsquo;ll get to that)</li>\n<li>a &ldquo;CommonJS&rdquo; module. This is for Node, you can&rsquo;t use it in a browser at all\nwithout using a build system.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if there&rsquo;s a better name for the &ldquo;classic&rdquo; type but I&rsquo;m just going\nto call it &ldquo;classic&rdquo;. Also there&rsquo;s a type called &ldquo;AMD&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m not sure how\nrelevant it is in 2024.</p>\n<p>Now that we know the 3 types of files, let&rsquo;s talk about how to figure out which\nof these the library actually provides!</p>\n<h3 id=\"where-to-find-the-files-the-npm-build\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#where-to-find-the-files-the-npm-build\">\n      where to find the files: the NPM build\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>Every Javascript library has a <strong>build</strong> which it uploads to NPM. You might be\nthinking (like I did originally) &ndash; Julia! The whole POINT is that we&rsquo;re not\nusing Node to build our library! Why are we talking about NPM?</p>\n<p>But if you&rsquo;re using a link from a CDN like <a href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/4.4.1/chart.umd.min.js\">https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/4.4.1/chart.umd.min.js</a>,\nyou&rsquo;re still using the NPM build! All the files on the CDNs originally come\nfrom NPM.</p>\n<p>Because of this, I sometimes like to <code>npm install</code> the library even if I&rsquo;m not\nplanning to use Node to build my library at all &ndash; I&rsquo;ll just create a new temp\nfolder, <code>npm install</code> there, and then delete it when I&rsquo;m done. I like being able to poke\naround in the files in the NPM build on my filesystem, because then I can be\n100% sure that I&rsquo;m seeing everything that the library is making available in\nits build and that the CDN isn&rsquo;t hiding something from me.</p>\n<p>So let&rsquo;s <code>npm install</code> a few libraries and try to figure out what types of\nJavascript files they provide in their builds!</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-library-1-chart-js\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#example-library-1-chart-js\">\n      example library 1: chart.js\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>First let&rsquo;s look inside <a href=\"https://www.chartjs.org\">Chart.js</a>, a plotting library.</p>\n<pre><code>$ cd /tmp/whatever\n$ npm install chart.js\n$ cd node_modules/chart.js/dist\n$ ls *.*js\nchart.cjs  chart.js  chart.umd.js  helpers.cjs  helpers.js\n</code></pre>\n<p>This library seems to have 3 basic options:</p>\n<p><strong>option 1:</strong> <code>chart.cjs</code>. The <code>.cjs</code> suffix tells me that this is a <strong>CommonJS\nfile</strong>, for using in Node. This means it&rsquo;s impossible to use it directly in the\nbrowser without some kind of build step.</p>\n<p><strong>option 2:<code>chart.js</code></strong>. The <code>.js</code> suffix by itself doesn&rsquo;t tell us what kind of\nfile it is, but if I open it up, I see <code>import '@kurkle/color';</code> which is an\nimmediate sign that this is an ES module &ndash; the <code>import ...</code> syntax is ES\nmodule syntax.</p>\n<p><strong>option 3: <code>chart.umd.js</code></strong>. &ldquo;UMD&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;Universal Module Definition&rdquo;,\nwhich I think means that you can use this file either with a basic <code>&lt;script src&gt;</code>, CommonJS,\nor some third thing called AMD that I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-use-a-umd-file\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#how-to-use-a-umd-file\">\n      how to use a UMD file\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>When I was using Chart.js I picked Option 3. I just needed to add this to my\ncode:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;script src=&quot;./chart.umd.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>and then I could use the library with the global <code>Chart</code> environment variable.\nCouldn&rsquo;t be easier. I just copied <code>chart.umd.js</code> into my Git repository so that\nI didn&rsquo;t have to worry about using NPM or the CDNs going down or anything.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-build-files-aren-t-always-in-the-dist-directory\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#the-build-files-aren-t-always-in-the-dist-directory\">\n      the build files aren&rsquo;t always in the <code>dist</code> directory\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>A lot of libraries will put their build in the <code>dist</code> directory, but not\nalways! The build files&rsquo; location is specified in the library&rsquo;s <code>package.json</code>.</p>\n<p>For example here&rsquo;s an excerpt from Chart.js&rsquo;s <code>package.json</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>  &quot;jsdelivr&quot;: &quot;./dist/chart.umd.js&quot;,\n  &quot;unpkg&quot;: &quot;./dist/chart.umd.js&quot;,\n  &quot;main&quot;: &quot;./dist/chart.cjs&quot;,\n  &quot;module&quot;: &quot;./dist/chart.js&quot;,\n</code></pre>\n<p>I think this is saying that if you want to use an ES Module (<code>module</code>) you\nshould use <code>dist/chart.js</code>, but the jsDelivr and unpkg CDNs should use\n<code>./dist/chart.umd.js</code>. I guess <code>main</code> is for Node.</p>\n<p><code>chart.js</code>&rsquo;s <code>package.json</code> also says <code>&quot;type&quot;: &quot;module&quot;</code>, which <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#modules-packages\">according to this documentation</a>\ntells Node to treat files as ES modules by default. I think it doesn&rsquo;t tell us\nspecifically which files are ES modules and which ones aren&rsquo;t but it does tell\nus that <em>something</em> in there is an ES module.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-library-2-atcute-oauth-browser-client\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#example-library-2-atcute-oauth-browser-client\">\n      example library 2: <code>@atcute/oauth-browser-client</code>\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/mary-ext/atcute/tree/trunk/packages/oauth/browser-client\"><code>@atcute/oauth-browser-client</code></a>\nis a library for logging into Bluesky with OAuth in the browser.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s see what kinds of Javascript files it provides in its build!</p>\n<pre><code>$ npm install @atcute/oauth-browser-client\n$ cd node_modules/@atcute/oauth-browser-client/dist\n$ ls *js\nconstants.js  dpop.js  environment.js  errors.js  index.js  resolvers.js\n</code></pre>\n<p>It seems like the only plausible root file in here is <code>index.js</code>, which looks\nsomething like this:</p>\n<pre><code>export { configureOAuth } from './environment.js';\nexport * from './errors.js';\nexport * from './resolvers.js';\n</code></pre>\n<p>This <code>export</code> syntax means it&rsquo;s an <strong>ES module</strong>. That means we can use it in\nthe browser without a build step! Let&rsquo;s see how to do that.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-use-an-es-module-with-importmaps\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#how-to-use-an-es-module-with-importmaps\">\n      how to use an ES module with importmaps\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>Using an ES module isn&rsquo;t an easy as just adding a <code>&lt;script src=&quot;whatever.js&quot;&gt;</code>. Instead, if\nthe ES module has dependencies (like <code>@atcute/oauth-browser-client</code> does) the\nsteps are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Set up an import map in your HTML</li>\n<li>Put import statements like <code>import { configureOAuth } from '@atcute/oauth-browser-client';</code> in your JS code</li>\n<li>Include your JS code in your HTML liek this: <code>&lt;script type=&quot;module&quot; src=&quot;YOURSCRIPT.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The reason we need an import map instead of just doing something like <code>import { BrowserOAuthClient } from &quot;./oauth-client-browser.js&quot;</code> is that internally the module has more import statements like <code>import {something} from @atcute/client</code>, and we need to tell the browser where to get the code for <code>@atcute/client</code> and all of its other dependencies.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what the importmap I used looks like for <code>@atcute/oauth-browser-client</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;script type=&quot;importmap&quot;&gt;\n{\n  &quot;imports&quot;: {\n    &quot;nanoid&quot;: &quot;./node_modules/nanoid/bin/dist/index.js&quot;,\n    &quot;nanoid/non-secure&quot;: &quot;./node_modules/nanoid/non-secure/index.js&quot;,\n    &quot;nanoid/url-alphabet&quot;: &quot;./node_modules/nanoid/url-alphabet/dist/index.js&quot;,\n    &quot;@atcute/oauth-browser-client&quot;: &quot;./node_modules/@atcute/oauth-browser-client/dist/index.js&quot;,\n    &quot;@atcute/client&quot;: &quot;./node_modules/@atcute/client/dist/index.js&quot;,\n    &quot;@atcute/client/utils/did&quot;: &quot;./node_modules/@atcute/client/dist/utils/did.js&quot;\n  }\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Getting these import maps to work is pretty fiddly, I feel like there must be a\ntool to generate them automatically but I haven&rsquo;t found one yet. It&rsquo;s definitely possible to\nwrite a script that automatically generates the importmaps using <a href=\"https://esbuild.github.io/api/#metafile\">esbuild&rsquo;s metafile</a> but I haven&rsquo;t done that and\nmaybe there&rsquo;s a better way.</p>\n<p>I decided to set up importmaps yesterday to get\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jvns/bsky-oauth-example\">github.com/jvns/bsky-oauth-example</a>\nto work, so there&rsquo;s some example code in that repo.</p>\n<p>Also someone pointed me to Simon Willison&rsquo;s\n<a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/2/download-esm/\">download-esm</a>, which will\ndownload an ES module and rewrite the imports to point to the JS files directly\nso that you don&rsquo;t need importmaps. I haven&rsquo;t tried it yet but it seems like a\ngreat idea.</p>\n<h3 id=\"problems-with-importmaps-too-many-files\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#problems-with-importmaps-too-many-files\">\n      problems with importmaps: too many files\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>I did run into some problems with using importmaps in the browser though &ndash; it\nneeded to download dozens of Javascript files to load my site, and my webserver\nin development couldn&rsquo;t keep up for some reason. I kept seeing files fail to\nload randomly and then had to reload the page and hope that they would succeed\nthis time.</p>\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t an issue anymore when I deployed my site to production, so I guess it\nwas a problem with my local dev environment.</p>\n<p>Also one slightly annoying thing about ES modules in general is that you need to\nbe running a webserver to use them, I&rsquo;m sure this is for a good reason but it&rsquo;s\neasier when you can just open your <code>index.html</code> file without starting a\nwebserver.</p>\n<p>Because of the &ldquo;too many files&rdquo; thing I think actually using ES modules with\nimportmaps in this way isn&rsquo;t actually that appealing to me, but it&rsquo;s good to\nknow it&rsquo;s possible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-use-an-es-module-without-importmaps\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#how-to-use-an-es-module-without-importmaps\">\n      how to use an ES module without importmaps\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>If the ES module doesn&rsquo;t have dependencies then it&rsquo;s even easier &ndash; you don&rsquo;t\nneed the importmaps! You can just:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>put <code>&lt;script type=&quot;module&quot; src=&quot;YOURCODE.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> in your HTML. The <code>type=&quot;module&quot;</code> is important.</li>\n<li>put <code>import {whatever} from &quot;https://example.com/whatever.js&quot;</code> in <code>YOURCODE.js</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"alternative-use-esbuild\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#alternative-use-esbuild\">\n      alternative: use esbuild\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to use importmaps, you can also use a build system like <a href=\"https://esbuild.github.io/\">esbuild</a>. I talked about how to do\nthat in <a href=\"https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/11/15/esbuild-vue/\">Some notes on using esbuild</a>, but this blog post is\nabout ways to avoid build systems completely so I&rsquo;m not going to talk about\nthat option here. I do still like esbuild though and I think it&rsquo;s a good option\nin this case.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-s-the-browser-support-for-importmaps\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#what-s-the-browser-support-for-importmaps\">\n      what&rsquo;s the browser support for importmaps?\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://caniuse.com/import-maps\">CanIUse</a> says that importmaps are in\n&ldquo;Baseline 2023: newly available across major browsers&rdquo; so my sense is that in\n2024 that&rsquo;s still maybe a little bit too new? I think I would use importmaps\nfor some fun experimental code that I only wanted like myself and 12 people to\nuse, but if I wanted my code to be more widely usable I&rsquo;d use <code>esbuild</code> instead.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-library-3-atproto-oauth-client-browser\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#example-library-3-atproto-oauth-client-browser\">\n      example library 3: <code>@atproto/oauth-client-browser</code>\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look at one final example library! This is a different Bluesky auth\nlibrary than <code>@atcute/oauth-browser-client</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>$ npm install @atproto/oauth-client-browser\n$ cd node_modules/@atproto/oauth-client-browser/dist\n$ ls *js\nbrowser-oauth-client.js  browser-oauth-database.js  browser-runtime-implementation.js  errors.js  index.js  indexed-db-store.js  util.js\n</code></pre>\n<p>Again, it seems like only real candidate file here is <code>index.js</code>. But this is a\ndifferent situation from the previous example library! Let&rsquo;s take a look at\n<code>index.js</code>:</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of stuff like this in <code>index.js</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>__exportStar(require(&quot;@atproto/oauth-client&quot;), exports);\n__exportStar(require(&quot;./browser-oauth-client.js&quot;), exports);\n__exportStar(require(&quot;./errors.js&quot;), exports);\nvar util_js_1 = require(&quot;./util.js&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>This <code>require()</code> syntax is CommonJS syntax, which means that we can&rsquo;t use this\nfile in the browser at all, we need to use some kind of build step, and\nESBuild won&rsquo;t work either.</p>\n<p>Also in this library&rsquo;s <code>package.json</code> it says <code>&quot;type&quot;: &quot;commonjs&quot;</code> which is\nanother way to tell it&rsquo;s CommonJS.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-use-a-commonjs-module-with-esm-sh-https-esm-sh\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#how-to-use-a-commonjs-module-with-esm-sh-https-esm-sh\">\n      how to use a CommonJS module with <a href=\"https://esm.sh\">esm.sh</a>\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>Originally I thought it was impossible to use CommonJS modules without learning\na build system, but then someone Bluesky told me about\n<a href=\"https://esm.sh\">esm.sh</a>! It&rsquo;s a CDN that will translate anything into an ES\nModule. <a href=\"https://www.skypack.dev/\">skypack.dev</a> does something similar, I&rsquo;m not\nsure what the difference is but one person mentioned that if one doesn&rsquo;t work\nsometimes they&rsquo;ll try the other one.</p>\n<p>For <code>@atproto/oauth-client-browser</code> using it seems pretty simple, I just need to put this in my HTML:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;script type=&quot;module&quot; src=&quot;script.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>and then put this in <code>script.js</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>import { BrowserOAuthClient } from &quot;https://esm.sh/@atproto/oauth-client-browser@0.3.0&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>It seems to Just Work, which is cool! Of course this is still sort of using a\nbuild system &ndash; it&rsquo;s just that esm.sh is running the build instead of me. My\nmain concerns with this approach are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I don&rsquo;t really trust CDNs to keep working forever &ndash; usually I like to copy dependencies into my repository so that they don&rsquo;t go away for some reason in the future.</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;ve heard of some issues with CDNs having security compromises which scares me. Also I don&rsquo;t</li>\n<li>I don&rsquo;t really understand what esm.sh is doing and</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"esbuild-can-also-convert-commonjs-modules-into-es-modules\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#esbuild-can-also-convert-commonjs-modules-into-es-modules\">\n      esbuild can also convert CommonJS modules into ES modules\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>I also learned that you can also use <code>esbuild</code> to convert a CommonJS module\ninto an ES module, though there are some limitations &ndash; the <code>import { BrowserOAuthClient } from</code> syntax doesn&rsquo;t work. Here&rsquo;s a <a href=\"https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/442\">github issue about that</a>.</p>\n<p>I think the <code>esbuild</code> approach is probably more appealing to me than the\n<code>esm.sh</code> approach because it&rsquo;s a tool that I already have on my computer so I\ntrust it more. I haven&rsquo;t experimented with this much yet though.</p>\n<h3 id=\"summary-of-the-three-types-of-files\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#summary-of-the-three-types-of-files\">\n      summary of the three types of files\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a summary of the three types of JS files you might encounter, options\nfor how to use them, and how to identify them.</p>\n<p>Unhelpfully a <code>.js</code> or <code>.min.js</code> file extension could be any of these 3\noptions, so if the file is <code>something.js</code> you need to do more detective work to\nfigure out what you&rsquo;re dealing with.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>&ldquo;classic&rdquo; JS files</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How to use it:</strong>: <code>&lt;script src=&quot;whatever.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></li>\n<li><strong>Ways to identify it:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The website has a big friendly banner in its setup instructions saying &ldquo;Use this with a CDN!&rdquo;  or something</li>\n<li>A <code>.umd.js</code> extension</li>\n<li>Just try to put it in a <code>&lt;script src=...</code> tag and see if it works</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>ES Modules</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ways to use it:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>If there are no dependencies, just <code>import {whatever} from &quot;./my-module.js&quot;</code> directly in your code</li>\n<li>If there are dependencies, create an importmap and <code>import {whatever} from &quot;my-module&quot;</code>\n<ul>\n<li>or use <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/2/download-esm/\">download-esm</a> to remove the need for an importmap</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Use <a href=\"https://esbuild.github.io/\">esbuild</a> or any ES Module bundler</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Ways to identify it:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Look for an <code>import </code> or <code>export </code> statement.

This makes me feel a lot more\nconfident using them, because browsers commit to backwards compatibility for\nweb standards forever &ndash; if I write some code using ES modules today, I can\nfeel sure that it&rsquo;ll still work the same way in 15 years.</p>\n<p>It also makes me feel better about using tooling like <code>esbuild</code> because even if\nthe esbuild project dies, because it&rsquo;s implementing a standard it feels likely\nthat there will be another similar tool in the future that I can replace it\nwith.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-js-community-has-built-a-lot-of-very-cool-tools\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#the-js-community-has-built-a-lot-of-very-cool-tools\">\n      the JS community has built a lot of very cool tools\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>A lot of the time when I talk about this stuff I get responses like &ldquo;I hate\njavascript!!! it&rsquo;s the worst!!!&rdquo;.

I love\nesbuild!), and that if I take the time to learn how things works I can take\nadvantage of some of those tools and make my life a lot easier.</p>\n<p>So the goal of this post is definitely not to complain about Javascript, it&rsquo;s\nto understand the landscape so I can use the tooling in a way that feels good\nto me.</p>\n<h3 id=\"questions-i-still-have\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#questions-i-still-have\">\n      questions I still have\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>Here are some questions I still have, I&rsquo;ll add the answers into the post if I\nlearn the answer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is there a tool that automatically generates importmaps for an ES Module that\nI have set up locally?

Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re running this command\nto watch for some specific output in a log file:</p>\n<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2\n</code></pre>\n<p>If log lines are being added to the file relatively slowly, the result I&rsquo;d see\nis&hellip; nothing! It doesn&rsquo;t matter if there were matches in the log file or not,\nthere just wouldn&rsquo;t be any output.</p>\n<p>I internalized this as &ldquo;uh, I guess pipes just get stuck sometimes and don&rsquo;t\nshow me the output, that&rsquo;s weird&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;d handle it by just\nrunning <code>grep thing1 /some/log/file | grep thing2</code> instead, which would work.</p>\n<p>So as I&rsquo;ve been doing a terminal deep dive over the last few months I was\nreally excited to finally learn exactly why this happens.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-this-happens-buffering\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#why-this-happens-buffering\">\n      why this happens: buffering\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>The reason why &ldquo;pipes get stuck&rdquo; sometimes is that it&rsquo;s VERY common for\nprograms to buffer their output before writing it to a pipe or file. So the\npipe is working fine, the problem is that the program never even wrote the data\nto the pipe!</p>\n<p>This is for performance reasons: writing all output immediately as soon as you\ncan uses more system calls, so it&rsquo;s more efficient to save up data until you\nhave 8KB or so of data to write (or until the program exits) and THEN write it\nto the pipe.</p>\n<p>In this example:</p>\n<pre><code>tail -f /some/log/file | grep thing1 | grep thing2\n</code></pre>\n<p>the problem is that <code>grep thing1</code> is saving up all of its matches until it has\n8KB of data to write, which might literally never happen.</p>\n<h3 id=\"programs-don-t-buffer-when-writing-to-a-terminal\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#programs-don-t-buffer-when-writing-to-a-terminal\">\n      programs don&rsquo;t buffer when writing to a terminal\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>Part of why I found this so disorienting is that <code>tail -f file | grep thing</code>\nwill work totally fine, but then when you add the second <code>grep</code>, it stops\nworking!! The reason for this is that the way <code>grep</code> handles buffering depends\non whether it&rsquo;s writing to a terminal or not.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how <code>grep</code> (and many other programs) decides to buffer its output:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check if stdout is a terminal or not using the <code>isatty</code> function\n<ul>\n<li>If it&rsquo;s a terminal, use line buffering (print every line immediately as soon as you have it)</li>\n<li>Otherwise, use &ldquo;block buffering&rdquo; &ndash; only print data if you have at least 8KB or so of data to print</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So if <code>grep</code> is writing directly to your terminal then you&rsquo;ll see the line as\nsoon as it&rsquo;s printed, but if it&rsquo;s writing to a pipe, you won&rsquo;t.</p>\n<p>Of course the buffer size isn&rsquo;t always 8KB for every program, it depends on the implementation. For <code>grep</code> the buffering is handled by libc, and libc&rsquo;s buffer size is\ndefined in the <code>BUFSIZ</code> variable. <a href=\"https://github.com/bminor/glibc/blob/c69e8cccaff8f2d89cee43202623b33e6ef5d24a/libio/stdio.h#L100\">Here&rsquo;s where that&rsquo;s defined in glibc</a>.</p>\n<p>(as an aside: &ldquo;programs do not use 8KB output buffers when writing to a\nterminal&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t, like, a law of terminal physics, a program COULD use an 8KB\nbuffer when writing output to a terminal if it wanted, it would just be\nextremely weird if it did that, I can&rsquo;t think of any program that behaves that\nway)</p>\n<h3 id=\"commands-that-buffer-commands-that-don-t\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#commands-that-buffer-commands-that-don-t\">\n      commands that buffer &amp; commands that don&rsquo;t\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>One annoying thing about this buffering behaviour is that you kind of need to\nremember which commands buffer their output when writing to a pipe.</p>\n<p>Some commands that <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> buffer their output:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>tail</li>\n<li>cat</li>\n<li>tee</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think almost everything else will buffer output, especially if it&rsquo;s a command\nwhere you&rsquo;re likely to be using it for batch processing.

The only examples I can come up with right now are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>tcpdump</li>\n<li><code>tail -f</code></li>\n<li>watching log files in a different way like with <code>kubectl logs</code></li>\n<li>the output of a slow computation</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"what-if-there-were-an-environment-variable-to-disable-buffering\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#what-if-there-were-an-environment-variable-to-disable-buffering\">\n      what if there were an environment variable to disable buffering?\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>I think it would be cool if there were a standard environment variable to turn\noff buffering, like <code>PYTHONUNBUFFERED</code> in Python.

This is because in\nan interactive program, <code>Ctrl-C</code> has a different job &ndash; if the program is\nrunning an operation (like for example a search in <code>less</code> or some Python code\nin <code>python3</code>), then <code>Ctrl-C</code> will interrupt that operation but not stop the\nprogram.</p>\n<p>As an example of how this works in an interactive program: here&rsquo;s the code <a href=\"https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/key_binding/bindings/vi.py#L2225\">in prompt-toolkit</a> (the library that iPython uses for handling input)\nthat aborts a search when you press <code>Ctrl-C</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rule-2-tuis-should-quit-when-you-press-q\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#rule-2-tuis-should-quit-when-you-press-q\">\n      rule 2: TUIs should quit when you press <code>q</code>\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>TUI programs (like <code>less</code> or <code>htop</code>) will usually quit when you press <code>q</code>.</p>\n<p>This rule doesn&rsquo;t apply to any program where pressing <code>q</code> to quit wouldn&rsquo;t make\nsense, like <code>tmux</code> or text editors.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rule-3-repls-should-quit-when-you-press-ctrl-d-on-an-empty-line\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#rule-3-repls-should-quit-when-you-press-ctrl-d-on-an-empty-line\">\n      rule 3: REPLs should quit when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code> on an empty line\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>REPLs (like <code>python3</code> or <code>ed</code>) will usually quit when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code> on an\nempty line. This rule is similar to the <code>Ctrl-C</code> rule &ndash; the reason for this is\nthat by default if you&rsquo;re running a program (like <code>cat</code>) in &ldquo;cooked mode&rdquo;, then\nthe operating system will return an <code>EOF</code> when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code> on an empty\nline.</p>\n<p>Most of the REPLs I use (sqlite3, python3, fish, bash, etc) don&rsquo;t actually use\ncooked mode, but they all implement this keyboard shortcut anyway to mimic the\ndefault behaviour.</p>\n<p>For example, here&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/shortcuts/prompt.py#L824-L837\">the code in prompt-toolkit</a>\nthat quits when you press Ctrl-D, and here&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://github.com/bminor/bash/blob/6794b5478f660256a1023712b5fc169196ed0a22/lib/readline/readline.c#L658-L672\">the same code in readline</a>.</p>\n<p>I actually thought that this one was a &ldquo;Law of Terminal Physics&rdquo; until very\nrecently because I&rsquo;ve basically never seen it broken, but you can see that it&rsquo;s\njust something that each individual input library has to implement in the links\nabove.</p>\n<p>Someone pointed out that the Erlang REPL does not quit when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code>,\nso I guess not every REPL follows this &ldquo;rule&rdquo;.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rule-4-don-t-use-more-than-16-colours\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#rule-4-don-t-use-more-than-16-colours\">\n      rule 4: don&rsquo;t use more than 16 colours\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>Terminal programs rarely use colours other than the base 16 ANSI colours. This\nis because if you specify colours with a hex code, it&rsquo;s very likely to clash\nwith some users&rsquo; background colour. For example if I print out some text as\n<code>#EEEEEE</code>, it would be almost invisible on a white background, though it would\nlook fine on a dark background.</p>\n<p>But if you stick to the default 16 base colours, you have a much better chance\nthat the user has configured those colours in their terminal emulator so that\nthey work reasonably well with their background color. Another reason to stick\nto the default base 16 colours is that it makes less assumptions about what\ncolours the terminal emulator supports.</p>\n<p>The only programs I usually see breaking this &ldquo;rule&rdquo; are text editors, for\nexample Helix by default will use a purple background which is not a default\nANSI colour. It seems fine for Helix to break this rule since Helix isn&rsquo;t a\n&ldquo;core&rdquo; program and I assume any Helix user who doesn&rsquo;t like that colorscheme\nwill just change the theme.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rule-5-vaguely-support-readline-keybindings\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#rule-5-vaguely-support-readline-keybindings\">\n      rule 5: vaguely support readline keybindings\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>Almost every program I use supports <code>readline</code> keybindings if it would make\nsense to do so.

They don&rsquo;t always mimic them <em>exactly</em>: for\nexample atuin seems to use <code>Ctrl-A</code> as a prefix, so <code>Ctrl-A</code> doesn&rsquo;t go to the\nbeginning of the line.</p>\n<p>Also all of these programs seem to implement their own internal cut and paste\nbuffers so you can delete a line with <code>Ctrl-U</code> and then paste it with <code>Ctrl-Y</code>.</p>\n<p>The exceptions to this are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>some programs (like <code>git</code>, <code>cat</code>, and <code>nc</code>) don&rsquo;t have any line editing support at all (except for backspace, <code>Ctrl-W</code>, and <code>Ctrl-U</code>)</li>\n<li>as usual text editors are an exception, every text editor has its own\napproach to editing text</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I wrote more about this &ldquo;what keybindings does a program support?&rdquo; question in\n<a href=\"https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/07/08/readline/\">entering text in the terminal is complicated</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rule-5-1-ctrl-w-should-delete-the-last-word\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#rule-5-1-ctrl-w-should-delete-the-last-word\">\n      rule 5.1: Ctrl-W should delete the last word\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen a program (other than a text editor) where <code>Ctrl-W</code> <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em>\ndelete the last word. This is similar to the <code>Ctrl-C</code> rule &ndash; by default if a\nprogram is in &ldquo;cooked mode&rdquo;, the OS will delete the last word if you press\n<code>Ctrl-W</code>, and delete the whole line if you press <code>Ctrl-U</code>. So usually programs\nwill imitate that behaviour.</p>\n<p>I can&rsquo;t think of any exceptions to this other than text editors but if there\nare I&rsquo;d love to hear about them!</p>\n<h3 id=\"rule-6-disable-colours-when-writing-to-a-pipe\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#rule-6-disable-colours-when-writing-to-a-pipe\">\n      rule 6: disable colours when writing to a pipe\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>Most programs will disable colours when writing to a pipe. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>rg blah</code> will highlight all occurrences of <code>blah</code> in the output, but if the\noutput is to a pipe or a file, it&rsquo;ll turn off the highlighting.</li>\n<li><code>ls --color=auto</code> will use colour when writing to a terminal, but not when\nwriting to a pipe</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both of those programs will also format their output differently when writing\nto the terminal: <code>ls</code> will organize files into columns, and ripgrep will group\nmatches with headings.</p>\n<p>If you want to force the program to use colour (for example because you want to\nlook at the colour), you can use <code>unbuffer</code> to force the program&rsquo;s output to be\na tty like this:</p>\n<pre><code>unbuffer rg blah |  less -R\n</code></pre>\n<p>I&rsquo;m sure that there are some programs that &ldquo;break&rdquo; this rule but I can&rsquo;t think\nof any examples right now. Some programs have an <code>--color</code> flag that you can\nuse to force colour to be on, in the example above you could also do <code>rg --color=always | less -R</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rule-7-means-stdin-stdout\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#rule-7-means-stdin-stdout\">\n      rule 7: <code>-</code> means stdin/stdout\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>Usually if you pass <code>-</code> to a program instead of a filename, it&rsquo;ll read from\nstdin or write to stdout (whichever is appropriate). For example, if you want\nto format the Python code that&rsquo;s on your clipboard with <code>black</code> and then copy\nit, you could run:</p>\n<pre><code>pbpaste | black - | pbcopy\n</code></pre>\n<p>(<code>pbpaste</code> is a Mac program, you can do something similar on Linux with <code>xclip</code>)</p>\n<p>My impression is that most programs implement this if it would make sense and I\ncan&rsquo;t think of any exceptions right now, but I&rsquo;m sure there are many\nexceptions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"these-rules-take-a-long-time-to-learn\" class=\"post-heading\">\n    <a href=\"#these-rules-take-a-long-time-to-learn\">\n      these &ldquo;rules&rdquo; take a long time to learn\n    </a>\n</h3>\n<p>These rules took me a long time for me to learn because I had to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>learn that the rule applied anywhere at all (&quot;<code>Ctrl-C</code> will exit programs&quot;)</li>\n<li>notice some exceptions (&ldquo;okay, <code>Ctrl-C</code> will exit <code>find</code> but not <code>less</code>&rdquo;)</li>\n<li>subconsciously figure out what the pattern is (&quot;<code>Ctrl-C</code> will generally quit\nnoninteractive programs, but in interactive programs it might interrupt the\ncurrent operation instead of quitting the program&quot;)</li>\n<li>eventually maybe formulate it into an explicit rule that I know</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A lot of my understanding of the terminal is honestly still in the\n&ldquo;subconscious pattern recognition&rdquo; stage.
