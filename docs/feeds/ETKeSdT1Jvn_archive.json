However, supporting reinforcement learning, decision-making, and control communities is equally crucial, as these fields drive innovation in areas like robotics, autonomous systems, and game-playing. This podcast explores the intersection of PyTorch and these fields, covering practical tips and tricks for working with PyTorch, an in-depth look at TorchRL, and discussions on debugging techniques, optimization strategies, and testing frameworks. By examining these topics, listeners will understand how to effectively use PyTorch for control systems and decision-making applications.\n\n// Bio\nVincent Moens is a research engineer on the PyTorch core team at Meta, based in London.

From gas attacks and bayonet wounds to rifle fire and artillery barrages, day-to-day life on the frontlines posed a serious risk to life and limb. The doctors and nurses responsible for medical care rose to the challenge, and the First World War saw a dramatic transformation in the provision of frontline medicine. Many more lives would be saved than lost due to the efforts of these 'lifesavers'.

The low-hanging use cases have largely been picked off. The next frontier will be AI coworkers who sit alongside knowledge workers, doing work side by side. At the infrastructure level, one of the most important primitives invented by man - the data center, is being fundamentally rethought in this new wave.\n\n// Bio\nAditya Naganath joined Kleiner Perkins’ investment team in 2022 with a focus on artificial intelligence, enterprise software applications, infrastructure and security. Prior to joining Kleiner Perkins, Aditya was a product manager at Google focusing on growth initiatives for the next billion users team. He previously was a technical lead at Palantir Technologies and formerly held software engineering roles at Twitter and Nextdoor, where he was a Kleiner Perkins fellow. Aditya earned a patent during his time at Twitter for a technical analytics product he co-created.\n\nOriginally from Mumbai India, Aditya graduated magna cum laude from Columbia University with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, and an MBA from Stanford University. Outside of work, you can find him playing guitar with a hard rock band, competing in chess or on the squash courts, and fostering puppies.

Before <em>Microsoft</em>, Guanhua earned his Computer Science PhD from UC Berkeley.\n\nDomino: Communication-Free LLM Training Engine // MLOps Podcast #278 with Guanhua \"Alex\" Wang, Senior Researcher at Microsoft.\n\n// Abstract\nGiven the popularity of generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs) often consume hundreds or thousands of GPUs to parallelize and accelerate the training process. Communication overhead becomes more pronounced when training LLMs at scale. To eliminate communication overhead in distributed LLM training, we propose Domino, which provides a generic scheme to hide communication behind computation. By breaking the data dependency of a single batch training into smaller independent pieces, Domino pipelines these independent pieces of training and provides a generic strategy of fine-grained communication and computation overlapping. Extensive results show that compared with Megatron-LM, Domino achieves up to 1.3x speedup for LLM training on Nvidia DGX-H100 GPUs.\n\n// Bio\nGuanhua Wang is a Senior Researcher in the DeepSpeed team at Microsoft. His research focuses on large-scale LLM training and serving. Previously, he led the ZeRO++ project at Microsoft which helped reduce over half of model training time inside Microsoft and Linkedin. He also led and was a major contributor to Microsoft Phi-3 model training.

Beyond the low cost of processing these news articles, these tools are also opening up a new, controversial, approach to KG building - unconstrained KGs. \n\nWe discuss the construction and exploration of the largest news-knowledge-graph on the planet - hosted on an endpoint at AskNews.app. During talk we aim to highlight some of the sacrifices and benefits that go hand-in-hand with using the infamous unconstrained KG approach.\n\nWe conclude the talk by explaining how knowledge graphs like these help to mitigate misinformation. We provide some examples of how our clients are using this graph, such as generating sports forecasts, generating better social media posts, generating regional security alerts, and combating human trafficking.\n\n// Bio\nRobert is the founder of Emergent Methods, where he directs research and software development for large-scale applications.
