As a big fan of the original Doom, I couldn't understand why people were saying Doom 2016 was like Doom - at all. So, I decided I'd do a fresh playthrough of the first level of both games. The results were more dramatic than I imagined. I could play through OG Doom's E1M1 over THIRTEEN times before I'd finish 2016's first level ONCE. I almost finished Doom's first level entirely before I even opened the first door in 2016. Fully twice before I picked up the 2016 shotgun. Hence; \"A Change of Pace\". \n\nSure, Doom 2016 is a relatively fast-paced shooter compared to many modern FPS games. But I think a lot of people either overlooked, or simply forgot, just how much faster the original Doom was. No tutorials, no cutscenes, no intros, no dialog popups, no RPG elements, no tech trees, no bullshit storyline nobody asked for, and a much more visceral, fast-paced, explosive type of action. In particular, Doom 2016's Glory Kills absolutely killed the pace and flow of that game, compared to the original, where you didn't need such useless (and repetitive) gimmicks, and most importantly, stuff actually DIED when you shot it. 2016's enemies are not only tankier, but are designed in such a way that hits don't kill them, but weaken them, to set them up for Glory Kills instead, something that's utterly not in line with what a true Doom game would be like. The outright killing power of Doom's arsenal is LEGENDARY, after all. \n\nYeah yeah yeah, and for those who asked, I just played it on a normal modern keyboard, one of the Epomaker ones. Maybe someday I'll day a \"Doom on a Doom Era Keyboard\" video with a Model M or something if you guys want :p .","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/3YIQeTrB-nM?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"When A President‚Äôs Party Destroys The White House...","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aqQZQT_4BY","date":1731855604,"author":"Weird History","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Most history classes leave out one of the best parts of the past: all the crazy parties.

It brought about profound social change and was a significant factor in the drift towards the Second World War.\nThe depth of suffering during the Depression years is hard for many of us to imagine today. More than 1 in five children in the city were suffering from malnutrition by 1932, and the Great Depression was only getting going at that point, it lasted seven more years. \nSo, why did events on Wall Street in 1929 reverberate around the world? Why did the depression last so long, and how did America and the rest of the world eventually dig themselves out of this financial hole?\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://twitter.com/PatrickEBoyle\n\nAdditional Reading:\nMilton Friedman on The Great Depression: https://amzn.to/4fvMYF6\nThe Great Depression by Robert S.

The genre is associated with heightened interpersonal drama - often centering around romance, competition, or lifestyles that are slightly out of the ordinary - yet there's been a slew of far more controversial reality shows in TV history. These dark stains on the genre are largely forgotten due to low ratings, early cancelations, and in some cases being so controversial that they never aired at all. While there are plenty of problematic reality shows in recent years, a good chunk of the most baffling and bizarre installments were dreamt up in the early aughts.\n\nTo read more about the most scandalous reality TV shows ever, go here:\nhttps://www.ranker.com/list/most-controversial-reality-shows/alexandra-kelley\n\nBe sure to subscribe to the Weird History Newsletter: https://www.ranker.com/newsletters/weird-history?utm_source=Youtube&utm_medium=WeirdHistory&utm_campaign=WHnewsletters&utm_content=description_box\n\n#reality #tv #weirdhistory","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/yK443ZftPC8?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"World's Rarest Production Rifle: The AN-94, Part 1 with firearms expert Jonathan Ferguson","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wXNfOki12M","date":1732119431,"author":"Royal Armouries","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"We have a very, very special one for you this week.\n\nDavid Lake of Small Arms Defense Journal describes a firearm that can \"fire, eject, reload, fire, eject and reload, with perfect reliability, while almost totally eliminating recoil, in less time than the human eye can blink.

But the story of how we got here is much more than a simple tale of breakthroughs, genius and men jumping out of baths shouting 'Eureka!' History of Science shows how the political upheavals of history combine with iconic inventions and discoveries, along with the ideas of great thinkers, to create the advances that have transformed our lives. Each episode starts with a disarmingly simple question that everyone asks, and then delves into the past, uncovering human stories and recreating the great experiments of the men and women who sought the answers and, in doing so, changed the world. Discover how science has found out what we are made of; where we came from; and what exists beyond Earth. Find out how science revealed the hidden secrets of nature; how it provided the force to topple kings and emperors; and how it unleashed untold power from within our planet. It's the story of how history made science, and science made history, and how the ideas that emerged made the modern world.\n\nThis is a channel from BBC Studios who help fund new BBC programmes.

Neil deGrasse Tyson sits down with theoretical physicist and Nobel Laureate Kip Thorne to reflect on discovering gravitational waves with LIGO, the science in the movie Interstellar, black holes, and many more mysteries still yet to be answered.\n\nDiscover the origin story of the movie Interstellar on its 10th anniversary. Kip explains how science, not fiction, shaped the film‚Äôs narrative‚Äîfrom the colossal waves on Miller‚Äôs planet to the physics behind black hole time dilation. Discover the recipe for how to create a wormhole and how turning on a time machine could cause it to self-destruct. Plus, learn about the Casimir effect, exotic particles, and how LIGO manipulated vacuum fluctuations to bypass the uncertainty principle. \n\nNeil and Kip dig into the origins of gravitational wave detection, tracing its roots to Joe Weber's early experiments and Ray Weiss's unpublished paper.  Kip reflects on the decades of work required to make LIGO a success, the challenges of measuring distortions a fraction of a proton‚Äôs width, and the historic detection of gravitational waves in 2016 that confirmed Einstein‚Äôs predictions. \n\nWhy don‚Äôt quantum physics and the theory of relativity mix? We discuss the mysteries of quantum gravity, the paradox of black hole information loss, and Kip‚Äôs legendary bet with Stephen Hawking and John Preskell. Kip explains why backward time travel may be possible, Hawking Radiation, and theories for why information can be lost. As they explore the intersection of science and art, Kip discusses his passion for storytelling and some of his future projects, from his poetry-art collaborations to documenting the history of LIGO.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Introduction: Kip Thorne\n04:47 - Creating the Movie Interstellar\n17:16 - The Giant Wave on Miller‚Äôs Planet\n24:01 - Time Dilation Around Gargantuan\n28:54 - Inside the Black Hole & Higher Dimension Spacetime\n34:05 - Using Wormholes to Travel Backwards in Time\n44:22 - Exotic Matter & Controlling Vacuum Fluctuations\n50:50 - Finding Gravitational Waves with LIGO\n01:07:01 - Winning The Nobel prize\n1:10:04 - Kip‚Äôs Bet on The Black Hole Information Paradox\n1:25:33 - The Problem with Relativity and Quantum Physics\n1:31:03 - Poetry, Documenting LIGO, & The Future\n1:40:08 - Closing Thoughts\n\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

Bluehost doesn‚Äôt influence our editorial decisions, but they make videos like this possible.\n\nWhen choosing a restaurant you probably look at a few things: What type of food do they serve? How close is it? Maybe if they‚Äôre allergen- or kid-friendly. You‚Äôre very likely looking at the list of entrees available to see if anything strikes you before even making a reservation. It‚Äôs a pretty typical way to choose a restaurant. After all, you want to enjoy your night out. But chef-instructor Kathryn Gordon from the Institute of Culinary Education in New York has one more suggestion: ‚ÄúI think you should try to look at the dessert menu more.‚Äù\n\nDesserts at most restaurants have gotten boring. You might find an incredible blend of cocktails or a wide-ranging wine list, followed by a well-curated list of sharable plates for appetizers, and of course the entrees will almost always offer some sort of wow factor. Oftentimes, dessert isn‚Äôt even on the main menu.

That decade brought to life classic unsolved cases such as the murder of Elizabeth Short in The Black Dahlia and the search for the Zodiac Killer in Zodiac. Serial killers were also brought to the big screen such as the story of Aileen Wuornos in Monster and Jeffrey Dahmer in Dahmer, both of which stirred controversy. Although these films may at times stretch the truth, they largely stick to the facts, which are indeed stranger than fiction in most cases. Which are still worth watching decades later, and which are best left forgotten?\n\nTo read more about great movies based off true incidents, go here:\nhttps://www.ranker.com/list/necromancy-facts/jen-jeffers\n\nBe sure to subscribe to the Weird History Newsletter: https://www.ranker.com/newsletters/weird-history?utm_source=Youtube&utm_medium=WeirdHistory&utm_campaign=WHnewsletters&utm_content=description_box\n\n#movies  #truestories #weirdhistory","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/fo7dDxnYbR4?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"19.

Helicopters such as the Westland Sea King. The most significant British naval helicopter in the last 60 years. What makes the Sea King stand out from other helicopters is its sheer versatility and adaptability. Over almost fifty years of service with the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force from 1969-2018, the Sea King was used in numerous roles, well beyond its original design as an anti-submarine warfare helicopter. It was what is known as a ‚Äòutility helicopter‚Äô ‚Äì an aircraft designed for multiple tasks. It saw service as a ‚Äòcommando‚Äô troop carrier, a heavy lift transport, an anti-ship helicopter, an airborne early warning aircraft, and even a search and rescue helicopter.

The doctor‚Äôs melancholic demeanor, described by the artist himself as \"the heartbroken expression of our time‚Äù, has afforded the work iconic status.\n\nIn 1990, 100 years after its creation, the portrait was auctioned in New York for 82 million US Dollars, the highest price ever paid for a work of art at the time.

How can we write better user stories and avoid these common mistakes? \n\nRequirements vs User Story Requirements, are they the same, are user story requirements a thing? There are really only three steps in building software, having an idea of the problem that we‚Äôd like to solve, building some software to solve it and then checking that the software does what we think and solves the problem. A User Story is focused on the first step, but if we get them right they make the next two steps much easier. \n\nIn this episode Dave Farley explores 5 common user story mistakes that make software engineering and continuous delivery more difficult, rather than easier. During his exploration of the mistakes, Dave describes some of the properties of better, more useful, user stories and the reasons why they are better.\n\nCD TRAINING COURSES\nIf you want to learn Continuous Delivery and DevOps skills, check out Dave Farley's courses\nhttps://bit.ly/DFTraining \n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS & LINKS\nYou can grab Dave Farley's new book 'Continuous Delivery Pipelines' here:\nhttps://leanpub.com/cd-pipelines\nDavid Farley ‚Ä¢ Modern Software Engineering ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3GI468M\nDave Farley & Jez Humble ‚Ä¢ Continuous Delivery ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3ocIHwd\nForsgren, Humble & Kim ‚Ä¢ Accelerate ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/367RI5o\nGojko Adzic & David Evans ‚Ä¢ 50 Quick Ideas to Improve your User Stories ‚Ä¢ https://leanpub.com/50quickideas\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#GOTOxDaveFarley #UserStories #StoryMistakes #Requirements #Programming #DaveFarley #GOTO #GOTOcon #Complexity  #ProgrammingTutorial #SoftwareEngineering\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos & other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

So he founded the Austrian Space Forum. Gr√∂mer sees himself as a \"shipbuilder‚Äù who‚Äôs working on making the journey to Mars possible in 20 to 30 years.\n\nTo this end, he conducts analog missions here on Earth. For these, scientists known as analog astronauts practice for the journey to the Red Planet, collecting knowledge along the way. AMADEE-24 is the name of the current mission, which will take place in 2024 in cooperation with the Armenian Space Agency in the Ararat region, an environment with Mars-like geology. \n\nThe film accompanies the mission through its highs and lows. However, the Austrian Space Forum and its many volunteers are not only practicing for the colonization of Mars. Under the direction of Gernot Gr√∂mer, they are also working on a nanosatellite that searches for space debris. Space may be infinite, but the Earth's nearby orbits now resemble a large garbage dump. \n\nEurope must keep a foot in the door, rather than leaving the space race up to China and the USA: That‚Äôs the goal of Augsburg rocket engineer Stefan Brieschenk. He founded the Rocket Factory Augsburg in 2018. He‚Äôs working hard, both here and in the far north of Sweden, on a rocket that will soon launch satellites into space from Europe -- at an unbeatable price. The Rocket Factory recycles items from other industrial sectors, including tanks from the brewing industry. \n\nA film that sheds light on the opportunities and risks inherent to the business of space. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The TT-33 or ‚ÄòTokarev‚Äô Pistol was named after its designer Fedor Tokarev, and was initially conceived as a modern replacement for the aging Nagant M1895 revolver. The simplicity of its design as well as an improvement in firepower would result in the production of over a million of the pistols by the end of the conflic.\n\nSecond is the Mosin-Nagant bolt-action rifle, the standard infantry weapon of the Red Army during World War II. Originally designed in 1891, the rifle would undergo several modifications before its M91/30 variant became standard issue for the Soviets. By the time World War Two had broken out, the rifle's ruggedness, reliability, and mass-production capability made it an indispensable weapon for the nation‚Äôs war effort. It was also used by the famous Soviet snipers of the era, including Vasily Zaitsev and Lyudmila Pavlichenko.\n\nThird up, the PPSh-41 or ‚ÄòPistolet-Pulemyot Shpagina‚Äô named after its designer Georgy Shpagin. This rapid weapon, capable of firing 1000 rounds per minute, was not simply a stunning submachine gun but a stalwart of the Red Army in World War Two. Adopted as a cost-effective alternative to the PPD-40, the PPSh-41 soon became a symbol of Soviet infantry firepower and played a critical role in the close quarters fighting  that has become synonymous with the sieges and battles of the Eastern Front.\n\nLast but not least is the 'DP', otherwise known as ‚ÄòDegtyaryov‚Äô machine gun. Designed for the Soviet Red Army in the 1920s under the leadership of Vasily Degtyaryov and trialled shortly before the Second World War broke out, the gas-operated DP would prove to be a much relied upon support weapon of the Red Army. Produced 800,000 times across four decades and with a service history that extends to the modern day, the DP proved to be an extremely trustworthy and versatile firearm - with many variations developed for multi-purpose use.\n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.

For testing, of course, this creates a challenge. Companies no longer control all the hardware or the data. There are many more assumptions in play. The industry is moving away from expensive kits that rarely break, to virtualised improvised magicked-up systems running on commodity hardware and likely to blow up at any time. This completely changes the risk profile for software architectures and tests. \n\nGojko Adzic will help you navigate this swamp and create a winning testing strategy for cloud deployments.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nGojko Adzic ‚Ä¢ Lizard Optimization ‚Ä¢ https://leanpub.com/lizardoptimization\nGojko Adzic ‚Ä¢ Impact Mapping ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3dQFCOq\nAdzic, Evans & Roden ‚Ä¢ Fifty Quick Ideas To Improve Your Tests ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3yuDaoL\nAdzic, Evans & Korac ‚Ä¢ Fifty Quick Ideas to Improve Your User Stories ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3jQ4QjP\nAdzic & Korac ‚Ä¢ Humans vs Computers ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/2Utz55A\nGojko Adzic ‚Ä¢ Specification by Example ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3hHrEjb\nAdzic, Marcetic & Bisset ‚Ä¢ Bridging the Communication Gap ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3wrjmRQ\nAdzic & Korac ‚Ä¢ Running Serverless ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3ytdF7o\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#BigData #MachineLearning #SoftwareEngineering #GojkoAdzic #Programming #YOWcon\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos & other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

While pollution caused by plastic waste threatens ecosystems, Jakarta is sinking into the sea. The city is quite literally going under. Climate activists and authorities are doing what they can to halt the process.\n\nIn addition to Indonesia‚Äôs own plastic waste, thousands of tons are brought to the country illegally every year despite a ban imposed in 2019. Disposed of improperly, much of it ends up in the sea and rivers. On the island of Bali, siblings Gary und Kelly have founded an organization to clear the masses of waste from waterways. To do this, they and their teams have built around 200 floating barriers. Through their efforts, more than 1,700 tons of garbage have been properly disposed of or recycled since 2020. \nIn Java, Daru Setyorini campaigns against environmental pollution. The Indonesian woman is head of the organization \"Ecoton‚Äù. Daru‚Äôs lab tests repeatedly detect microplastic particles in food. This is because many factories use plastic waste as fuel - including in food production. \nMeanwhile, residents of the soon-to-be former capital Jakarta are facing another environmental problem: due to global warming and the excessive extraction of groundwater, the country's largest city is sinking several centimeters every year - around 40% of the urban area is now below sea level. Environmental experts warn that a third of Jakarta could be permanently flooded by 2050 if subsidence continues at the current rate. While former President Joko Widodo approved the plan to build the new capital Nusantara on the island of Borneo in August 2019, authorities and specialists are building a dike in a bid to protect Jakarta from the rising waters.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

For the past thirty years the space programs of many nations have been sending landed platforms of increasing complexity, revealing the Red Planet‚Äôs ancient past. One of the most challenging aspects of all missions to Mars is the ability to achieve a safe landing on the surface, from an initial entry speed of 30,000 miles per hour to a soft touchdown. During the descent to the surface robots and eventually people must be protected from extreme temperatures and G-forces by complex engineered systems. On the surface they must be able to survive radiation and low pressures, with only the limited resources they can bring with them.\n\nThis talk will discuss the motivation for Mars exploration and how engineering challenges are tackled with computational modeling, cutting-edge technologies, and out-of-the-box thinking. Engineering the Red Planet is the key to our future and understanding our past.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nNASA ‚Ä¢ NASA Systems Engineering Handbook ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3FWjqhR\nBernice Kastner ‚Ä¢ Space Mathematics ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3oQCDKF\nKellie Gerardi ‚Ä¢ Not Necessarily Rocket Science ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3CW4HS9\nPiers Bizony & Roger D.

It is a whole-team approach to doing all the work the team does including designing, coding, testing, and working with the customers, users and other stakeholders. This is an evolutionary step beyond pair programming and accentuates face-to-face communication, team alignment, collaboration, and self-organizing team concepts of the Agile approach to software development.\n\nMob Programming can be a highly effective approach to software development. There are numerous teams doing Mob Programming all over the world, including distributed teams, and there have been a number of positive reports of success. Please join me as I share how the concept got started, the benefits, techniques we use, and some of the problems we've faced.\n\nStructure This presentation provides a description of Mob Programming, how is came to be, the benefits we've seen, and some tips on how to do it yourself. It is presented as a talk with slides, with some audience participation.\n\nLearning outcome You will learn enough to try this out on your own with your team or with some friends.

Jose Maria simply wants to ensure that the children in the slums are well fed. Dried soy is rich in protein and can help prevent malnutrition.

Key concepts such as deliberate practice, retrieval practice, and the value of psychological safety in team dynamics are explored, offering insights into effective learning and collaboration. The relationship between working memory and long-term memory is examined, highlighting how techniques like the Pomodoro Technique and spaced repetition optimize retention. Additionally, the conversation underscores the potential of AI in education, encouraging its integration despite concerns among educators.\n\nLastly, the phenomenon of rustiness in skill retention is explained through the dynamics of neural connections, with a hopeful outlook on the future of neuroscience research in understanding conditions like autism and dyslexia.

Meanwhile, the Stop Finning campaign has collected over one million petition signatures, and is forcing the European Commission to address the issue. Activists want an EU-wide ban on the shark fin trade. But for many people in Vigo, fishing is their livelihood. \n\nThis film exposes Europe's shark trade and the effects it has on marine ecosystems. Can a balance be found between economic interests and the protection of our natural world?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #sharks \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

However, as the number of APIs continues to grow exponentially, managing their interop and governing their compliance becomes a critical challenge. Traditional API governance approaches are usually relying on manual processes and often lag behind development cycles, leading to release delays, inconsistencies, and increased technical debt.\n\nThis real-world experience report will share a set of transformative strategies that helped us elevate our DevEx by an order of magnitude, while simultaneously helping us shorten our cycle times by 50%.\n\nWe delve into the principles of \"shift-left\" API governance, a proactive approach that integrates governance early in the development cycle, ensuring faster, more secure, and compliant API integrations. By starting with a collaborative API Design first approach followed by contract testing in service provider's CI pipeline, teams can identify and mitigate risks sooner, streamline workflows, and foster a culture of collaboration, accountability and innovation. This helps them unlock unprecedented developer productivity and accelerate their release cycles.\n\nKey highlights of the talk include:\n‚Ä¢ Exponential Improvement in DevEx: Learn how to enhance API development using industry-leading tools and processes that result in a 10x improvement in developer satisfaction and productivity.\n‚Ä¢ Shift-Left Governance: Discover the mechanics of implementing shift-left practices in API governance, enabling earlier detection of integration issues, reduced rework, and accelerated time-to-market.\n‚Ä¢ Halving Cycle Time: Uncover the strategic and technical adjustments necessary to reduce cycle times by 50%, transforming the speed at which products reach the market without compromising quality.\n‚Ä¢ Real-World Applications: Gain insights from successful real world implementations where these principles have been applied, showcasing tangible outcomes and lessons learned.\n‚Ä¢ Future-Proofing Your API Strategy: Equip yourself with the knowledge to not only improve current processes but also to adapt to future challenges and opportunities in API development.\n\nJoin us for an enlightening session that promises not only to inspire but also to equip you with practical tools, practices and insights to revolutionize your API design, development and governance strategy. Whether you're a developer, a technical leader, or a product manager, this talk will provide valuable perspectives on enhancing DevEx, streamlining governance, and achieving remarkable efficiency gains.

Throughout their history, the Yanomami have had to defend themselves against cultural oppression, environmental destruction, epidemics and violence. Since the 1970s, illegal gold mining in particular has posed a threat and destroyed the indigenous people's habitat. Time and time again, deadly clashes occur between illegal gold miners and Amazon communities.\n\nThe situation was further exacerbated when former Brazilian President Bolsonaro declared his intention to legalize the extraction of resources in Yanomami territory. Davi Kopenawa has decided to seek international support for the cause. He‚Äôs certain that if the shamans stop dancing and life in the rainforest is thrown out of balance, the sky will fall and crush everything beneath it - not just the Yanomami. But can he convince those who are running the country?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #amazonrainforest  \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

For some, like prominent activist Mazen Al-Hamada, help arrived too late. He is believed to have been executed shortly before the regime‚Äôs collapse. \n\nHis body was reportedly found at a morgue in the Harasta Hospital, linked to the notorious Sednaya prison, also known as ‚Äúthe human slaughterhouse‚Äù.  The Assad regime disposed of inmates' bodies at the hospital‚Äôs morgue before burying them in mass graves. Mazen‚Äôs body had visible signs of torture and beatings, according to reports. \n\nSince 2011, after a series of protests broke out in Syria, tens of thousands of men, women and children had been forcefully disappeared into secret detention centers. Survivors accuse the regime of crimes against humanity. \n\nThis documentary, first released in 2017, sheds light on the brutality of Syria‚Äôs fallen regime. In it, Mazen Al-Hamada shares his accounts of his first imprisonment between the years 2012 and 2013. Survivors of the prisons and the families of other victims recount their pain and despair. \n\nBill Wiley and his team of war crime investigators smuggled material out of Syria to a secret location in Europe. They extracted around 600,000 pages of official government documents ‚Äì a wealth of potential evidence against the Assad regime that could help build the case for a criminal prosecution along the lines of the Nuremberg trials. The paper trail led the prosecutors to the fate of the protestors who took to the streets in 2011. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #syria #assad \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Then, you remember you‚Äôre also a software engineer, and the solution becomes suddenly obvious. Join me in this session, where I'll demonstrate how I enhanced my music composition process by harnessing the power of Java and AI.\n\nThis presentation will discuss the core architectural patterns for introducing AI capabilities into an existing software system, exploring concepts like templated prompts, agent tools, and integration of external knowledge. The Java ecosystem is getting more and more capabilities for building AI applications. But are they ready for production? Are there any gaps?\n\nThroughout the session, I‚Äôll build a \"composer assistant\" application using Java and an AI Orchestrator (LangChain4J, Spring AI) to showcase how to make an LLM application production-ready. Is the developer experience affected when working locally with language models? How is observability different when it comes to tokens? Can we ensure resilience across the many integrations orchestrated by the AI? What strategies are available for deploying LLM applications?\n\nIn a final twist, you‚Äôll choose which movie scene to score, and I‚Äôll compose and perform the music live for it, supported by AI. Will it meet the mark? There‚Äôs only one way to find out: join me in exploring the practical side of AI applications, where Java and Generative AI offer tangible solutions to real-world use cases.

That‚Äôs why tobacco multinationals are increasingly focused on e-cigarettes, enticing consumers with bright colors and fruity flavors. The target group: young people.\n\nThe World Health Organization says smoking results in the death of eight million people every year. That‚Äôs one reason why you‚Äôll now often hear tobacco companies promoting the switch to e-cigarettes, with claims that these are less harmful to our health. It‚Äôs first and foremost young people who believe the industry‚Äôs promises, thereby taking the first step on the road to addiction. After all, nicotine is an addictive substance. And although it may taste better than tobacco, puffing on a vape is still going to get you hooked in precisely the same way as smoking a regular cigarette. The film investigates the cynicism of an industry that not only accepts this, but also deliberately aims for it.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

In the very first days of the war, Russian troops occupied the exclusion zone around what‚Äôs left of Chernobyl. Shortly afterwards, they took control of Zaporizhzhia‚Äôs nuclear power plant.\n\nRussian troops withdrew from Chernobyl after a few weeks. But Zaporizhzhia, Europe's largest nuclear power plant, has effectively been occupied since March 2022. The plant has come under frequent attack, the power supply has been interrupted and fires have broken out. Experts have repeatedly warned of a possible nuclear disaster. How safe are nuclear power plants in a time of war? And how is the Russian occupation affecting the nuclear plant‚Äôs Ukrainian employees? What can the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) do? \n\nThe documentary follows three employees of Ukrainian nuclear power plants and describes the consequences of the Russian occupation. These include fear, illegal interrogations and torture. For IAEA chief Rafael Grossi, staff working conditions are the biggest cause for concern. \n\nDirector Pavlo Cherepin‚Äôs involvement in the film brought back personal memories. He learned the word evacuation early in his childhood, following the Chernobyl reactor accident.

A civilization's plumbing can teach us about the diets they ate, the diseases they contracted, how they conducted civil engineering projects, and possibly even what their attitudes about bathrooms were. \n\nBut our information about ancient bathrooms and toilets is still fairly new, especially when it comes to ancient Rome. Until recently, the bathroom habits of the ancients weren't considered an appropriate subject for academic study. When previous archaeologists did unearth ancient toilets, they came up with fantastical alternate reasons for their uses to avoid describing how they were actually used. When Italian excavator Giacomo Boni discovered a Roman toilet in 1913, he imagined that it was a water pump that powered the entire house. \n\nTo  read more about Roman toilets and plumbing, go here:\nhttps://www.ranker.com/list/ancient-roman-toilets-history/jim-rowley\n\nBe sure to subscribe to the Weird History Newsletter: https://www.ranker.com/newsletters/weird-history?utm_source=Youtube&utm_medium=WeirdHistory&utm_campaign=WHnewsletters&utm_content=description_box\n\n#ancientrome #plumbing #weirdhistory","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/9HaCRGeolMc?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Coping with dementia - The challenges families face | DW Documentary","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW2m73vJKps","date":1734282041,"author":"DW Documentary","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"What kind of environment is the right one for people with dementia? The film explores new ways to provide more appropriate care to sufferers of this disease.\n\nDementia is a disease that not only torments those affected, but also often puts relationships with loved ones under severe strain. 1.8 million people in Germany suffer from dementia. It‚Äôs estimated that by 2050, that figure could rise to more than 2.8 million. The question of appropriate and, above all, humane care is becoming increasingly urgent. Most dementia sufferers are accommodated in care homes. However, this is often not the best concept, due to a shortage of skilled nursing staff and other factors. What is needed are places where people can feel safe and secure.\n\nIn this report, we meet people with first-hand experience of dementia - like Julia Bernsee, whose mother was diagnosed with the disease in 2019. Her mother was able to stay at home initially, but then Julia took her into her own home. When her mother spent some time in a nursing home, Julia was alarmed at the realities of care in such places. This is because dementia patients are often sedated with medication. But then Julia found a new facility.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #dementia \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
