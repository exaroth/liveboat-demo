Every filesystem operation and memory allocation generates cryptographic proofs that can be verified in real-time, ensuring system integrity. Think of it like a blockchain for OS operations rather than just storage verification.<p>Key features:\n- Merkle tree-backed filesystem with operation verification\n- Memory manager with CoW and proof generation\n- Buddy allocator with zone-based memory management\n- Shell with VT100 support\n- Verified boot sequence with stage attestation<p>The kernel is still in alpha, but it demonstrates a novel approach to OS security by making verification a first-class citizen. All critical operations (memory allocations, filesystem writes, process creation) generate proofs that are stored in an append-only chain, similar to a blockchain but for system operations.<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/JGiraldo29/vekos\">https://github.com/JGiraldo29/vekos</a><p>I would be excited to get feedback on this project, especially on the verification approach and potential use cases.
