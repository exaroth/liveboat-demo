      "content": "I decided to learn and record the newly-discovered 'Waltz' attributed to Chopin. The media and some scholars are trumpeting this as a landmark discovery of an unknown work of Chopin, but I gather there's still plenty of healthy skepticism among pianists and scholars. While there is consensus that the notated piece is in Chopin's hand, Chopin's name and the title of piece seem to have been added by someone else. It's not even certain that was conceived as a waltz. The work is not signed by Chopin, and it is possible this is the product of a compositional exercise between Chopin and a student. It is also possible that Chopin transcribed somebody else's piece by ear out of curiosity, or for some other unknown purpose. Other oddities have been noted: the triple-forte that is out-of-proportion for such a short work, added fingerings that Chopin used only sparingly, and the 16th-beamed triplets in bars 10, 16, and 19 that should be 8th-triplets.\n\nEven if it is probable that the piece is an original work by Chopin that he simply chose not to develop and tossed aside, it might be wise to withhold judgement until more scholars have examined the evidence and a consensus is reached on the question of its authenticity! For now, the verdict is still out.\n\nHaving said that, it is indisputably a charming work, and – now that I've gotten in my fingers and lived with it for a few hours – I can say definitively that it is at least \"Chopinesque.\" ;)\n\n(My current favorite hypothesis is that this is, in fact, \"a Chopin,\" but that it was an inside-joke of some kind composed for a friend that wasn't intended to be taken entirely seriously – that would help explain the triple-forte, and perhaps the fingerings too.)\n\nFull press release from the Morgan Library: https://host.themorgan.org/press/Morgan_Chopin_MediaRelease.pdf\n\nCommentary by Artur Szklener of the Fryderyk Chopin Institute in Warsaw: https://chopin.nifc.pl/en/chopin/aktualnosci/news/98\n\nMeanwhile, there are lots of amazing Waltzes Chopin definitely did write that I wish the media paid more attention to! I'm in the middle of producing an in-depth series exploring Chopin's different compositional genres, and Episode 7: Waltzes is scheduled for release on November 15, starring Garrick Ohlsson and featuring special guests Stephen Hough and Mark Ainley.\n\nFor more info, visit: https://www.chopinpodcast.com/\n\nAnd make sure to follow the podcast on Apple/Spotify:\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-chopin-podcast/id1765998900\nhttps://open.spotify.com/show/1iML5oPZ1LV4jnH8xCUsn4?si=607ca583fd204d86\n\nSupport my channel: https://www.patreon.com/BenLaude\nFollow me: https://www.instagram.com/benlawdy",

Become a Vox Member today: http://www.vox.com/memberships\n\nIn 1990, the FDA banned the use of Red No. 3 in topical drugs and cosmetics. Their cited reasoning was that the color additive was “not shown to be safe,” because when fed to rats, Red No. 3 was found to slightly increase the risk of thyroid cancer.  Today, that same dye is still found in candy corn, ring pops, Pez, and nearly 3,000 other foods that we eat, which raises the question: If it’s not safe to put on our skin … is it really safe to ingest? Many researchers, advocates, and now state lawmakers say no.\n\nLast year, California passed a bill formally banning Red Dye No. 3 and several other additives from food in the state. The bill gives the food industry until 2027 to remove the additives from their products. The industry is already responding, with companies like Pediasure quickly removing the dye from their shakes.\n\nThe question remains, though: Where is the federal ban on Red No. 3 in food if the FDA deemed it unsafe for topical uses over 30 years ago? \n\nVox’s podcast Explain It to Me put out an episode about dyes, too.

      "content": "Historian Dan Snow takes a deep dive into the historical accuracy of movies that depict the President of the United States. \n\nFirst off Dan reviews 'Lincoln' (2012), in which oscar-winning actor Daniel Day-Lewis stars as the iconic 16th U.S. President, Abraham Lincoln, as he strives to abolish slavery with the passing of the 13th Amendment as civil war rages on in his beloved nation. \n\nNext, Dan looks at Christopher Nolan's blockbuster 'Oppenheimer' (2023), starring Cillian Murphy and Gary Oldman, who plays Harry S. Truman, the 33rd U.S. President. He focuses on the chilling meeting between Truman and the psychologically traumatised physicist, who worries what he has unleashed by creating the Atomic Bomb. As we'll see, Truman was far from sympathetic. \n\nNext up is 'Thirteen Days' (2000), a drama that focuses on John F. Kennedy's handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962. Often seen as the 35th U.S. President's finest hour, Dan looks to sort fact from fiction as Kennedy and his advisors seek to resolve this existential threat to humanity.\n\nDan then moves onto reviewing Bryan Cranston's depiction of 36th U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson in 'All the Way' (2016), as he strives to push the Civil Rights Bill through the U.S. Senate, before receiving intelligence from Vietnam that would alter the course of his premiership.\n\n'Frost/Nixon' (2008) is the penultimate film, starring Martin Sheen and Frank Langella, which sees UK chat show host David Frost interview Richard M. Nixon in an unlikely turn of events. What might initially seem as an easy opportunity for the 37th U.S. President to set the record straight on the Watergate Scandal soon turns into a metaphorical boxing match between the interviewer and disgraced former president.\n\nLastly, Dan watches Adam McKay's 'Vice' (2018), starring Christian Bale as 43rd U.S. President, George W. Bush's infamous vice-president Dick Cheney. Was Cheney really the puppet master in Bush's administration? Dan gives his thoughts.\n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.

But if you understand what polls are actually capable of telling you, it might dispel any desire you have for them to predict whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump will be the next president. \n\nWe interviewed pollsters about their processes and explained the basics of how they turn small surveys into a way to measure the entirety of a voting population. No matter what measures pollsters take to make their samples as representative as possible, there’s a limit to how precise they can be. And, sometimes, those same measures can make the poll numbers go awry. \n\nSources and further reading:\n\nCourtney Kennedy, who we interviewed for this piece and is in the video, co-wrote this helpful primer on how to read election polls: \nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/08/28/key-things-to-know-about-us-election-polling-in-2024/\n\nWe interviewed Brian Schaffner, a political scientist at Tufts University, who co-wrote this blog post on weighting polls for this election: \nhttps://goodauthority.org/news/pollsters-are-weighting-surveys-differently-in-2024/\n\nIf you want to better understand the polling errors in the 2016 and 2020 elections: \n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/upshot/poll-changes-2024-trump.html\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/upshot/polls-what-went-wrong.html\n\nhttps://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-pollsters-have-changed-since-2016-and-what-still-worries-them-about-2020/\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

The surgery was a success, and the patient would go on to live with the transplanted organ thanks to one key factor: it came from his identical twin. 70 years later, nearly 100,000 kidneys are transplanted annually in the US alone. So how does this surgery work today? Alexander H. Toledo explains the procedure.\n\nLesson by Alexander H.

In many ways, Rome wasn't so different from today's world: It had \"professionals\" of various classes, there were same-gender relationships, and people really loved seeing depictions of \"the act.\" \n\nBut there was also a dark side.\n\n\nTo read more about sexual norms in ancient Rome, go here:\nhttps://www.ranker.com/list/intimacy-in-ancient-rome/aaron-edwards\n\n\nBe sure to subscribe to the Weird History Newsletter: https://www.ranker.com/newsletters/weird-history?utm_source=Youtube&utm_medium=WeirdHistory&utm_campaign=WHnewsletters&utm_content=description_box\n\n#romanempire #sex #weirdhistory",

While people should be feeling these tangible economic improvements, surveys show that Americans are the most pessimistic they have been about the economy in thirty years.  \nTikTokers have coined the term “the silent depression,” claiming that it’s harder to get by today than it was during the great depression.

Tiye may have blazed a trail for the world’s leading religions – and the belief that there is only one true god.\n\n0:52:35 - The Other Cleopatra: Cleopatra II, namesake of the great Cleopatra VII, had an even more shocking reign. Hers is a dramatic tale of incest, murder, rape and mutilation. Cleopatra II wielded great power and would do anything to keep it. She saw her dynasty torn apart by hatred—but she also saved it from destruction.\n\n1:44:36 - Cleopatra Selene: Cleopatra Selene, daughter of Cleopatra the Great and Mark Antony, saw her dynasty collapse amid her parents’ defeat and suicide. Taken to Rome as a prisoner, all looked lost for Selene. But she rose from the embers to marry the African king Juba II and become one of the continent’s greatest queens.\n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Matt Lewis and more.

      "content": "The Battle of Teutoburg forest is a story of betrayal, of one man’s vehement desire to liberate his people from Roman rule and the brutal, bloody lengths he would go to achieve it. \n\nTristan Hughes heads to Germany to investigate how these German 'barbarians' beat one of history’s most powerful and well trained armies. With contemporary writing and expert historians on hand he walks in the footsteps of what's now remembered as the Varian disaster.\n\nIn the early first century the Romans saw Germania as a land of forests and swamps full of backwards people, a place easy for them to conquer and control for their growing empire. German tribes were paying taxes, giving tributes and sending their high born sons to Rome, it was all going so well…but within this flourishing empire was a growing resentment of ruthless Roman rule.  \n\nIn early 9AD Roman forces led by Roman General Publius Quinctillius Varus crossed into the area of Germania run by the Cherusci tribe. Luckily for them they had a high profile Cherusci on their side who had been educated in Rome, he was the perfect tamed barbarian, Arminius. Arminus would be their guide to all things Cherusci, helping negotiate trade deals with the area’s Germanic tribes and ensuring safe passage throughout Barbaricium. \n\nTo control this potentially hostile area, Varus and Arminius were aided by three legions, roughly 15,000 men, who were highly efficient trained killers. By Summer this team of Cherusci and Roman’s had hacked their way further into the heartlands of Barbaricium, spending time in ‘friendly’ territory…but little did they know there was a traitor in their midst…Arminius aided by thousands of Germans had a plan that was about to change Roman history…forever! \n\nAt the end of the summer Varus and his men were dismantling their camp ready for a return to the safety of the Rhine, but shock erupted through the camp as news broke of an uprising. A group of Germans had risen in revolt against Roman rule! \n\nVarus and his legions decided they had one more fight in them before they headed back for a restful winter. They marched into Barbaricum, ready for an easy win against these troublesome Germans. \n\nVarus and his men headed deeper and deeper into Germania unaware of the impending danger that lurked for them within the dense forest ahead.\n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.

      "content": "I saw a video on YT recently that inspired me to do this comparison. As a big fan of the original Doom, I couldn't understand why people were saying Doom 2016 was like Doom - at all. So, I decided I'd do a fresh playthrough of the first level of both games. The results were more dramatic than I imagined. I could play through OG Doom's E1M1 over THIRTEEN times before I'd finish 2016's first level ONCE. I almost finished Doom's first level entirely before I even opened the first door in 2016. Fully twice before I picked up the 2016 shotgun. Hence; \"A Change of Pace\". \n\nSure, Doom 2016 is a relatively fast-paced shooter compared to many modern FPS games. But I think a lot of people either overlooked, or simply forgot, just how much faster the original Doom was. No tutorials, no cutscenes, no intros, no dialog popups, no RPG elements, no tech trees, no bullshit storyline nobody asked for, and a much more visceral, fast-paced, explosive type of action. In particular, Doom 2016's Glory Kills absolutely killed the pace and flow of that game, compared to the original, where you didn't need such useless (and repetitive) gimmicks, and most importantly, stuff actually DIED when you shot it. 2016's enemies are not only tankier, but are designed in such a way that hits don't kill them, but weaken them, to set them up for Glory Kills instead, something that's utterly not in line with what a true Doom game would be like. The outright killing power of Doom's arsenal is LEGENDARY, after all. \n\nYeah yeah yeah, and for those who asked, I just played it on a normal modern keyboard, one of the Epomaker ones. Maybe someday I'll day a \"Doom on a Doom Era Keyboard\" video with a Model M or something if you guys want :p .",

Why did the depression last so long, and how did America and the rest of the world eventually dig themselves out of this financial hole?\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://twitter.com/PatrickEBoyle\n\nAdditional Reading:\nMilton Friedman on The Great Depression: https://amzn.to/4fvMYF6\nThe Great Depression by Robert S.

This is an error. Crimea is an internationally recognised part of Ukraine.\n\nOn the 3rd of October 1952, the UK detonated its first atomic bomb and became the world's third nuclear power. It was the first of 45 nuclear weapons detonated by the United Kingdom across Australia, Kiritimati, and the United States.\n\nThere were over 22,000 British service personnel at these tests and an unknown number of local people - many of whom claim they were exposed to unsafe levels of radiation. America, France, Russia and China have accepted culpability for hurting their nuclear veterans. But the British Government has not. \n\nAccording to them, \"the MOD does not accept that participants at the UK atmospheric nuclear test and weapons experiments were, as a result, exposed to ionising radiation that adversely affected their health.\"\n\nThe nuclear tests did their job. They ensured that Britain has kept place at the top table of world politics to this day. But 70 years on, the legacy of those test is still up for debate.\n\n*Note - This video is a reupload of a previous video first published in 2023.\n\nRead more about Britain’s history of nuclear weapons here:\nhttps://www.iwm.org.uk/history/the-history-of-britains-nuclear-weapons\n\nPlan your visit: https://www.iwm.org.uk/visits/iwm-london \n\nExplore and licence the film clips used in this video from IWM Film:\nhttps://film.iwmcollections.org.uk/mycollections/index/3711\n\nFollow IWM on social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/I_W_M\nhttps://www.instagram.com/imperialwarmuseums/ \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/iwm.london\n\nFilm badge radiation dose monitors by The Board of Trustees of the Science Museum.

The genre is associated with heightened interpersonal drama - often centering around romance, competition, or lifestyles that are slightly out of the ordinary - yet there's been a slew of far more controversial reality shows in TV history. These dark stains on the genre are largely forgotten due to low ratings, early cancelations, and in some cases being so controversial that they never aired at all. While there are plenty of problematic reality shows in recent years, a good chunk of the most baffling and bizarre installments were dreamt up in the early aughts.\n\nTo read more about the most scandalous reality TV shows ever, go here:\nhttps://www.ranker.com/list/most-controversial-reality-shows/alexandra-kelley\n\nBe sure to subscribe to the Weird History Newsletter: https://www.ranker.com/newsletters/weird-history?utm_source=Youtube&utm_medium=WeirdHistory&utm_campaign=WHnewsletters&utm_content=description_box\n\n#reality #tv #weirdhistory",

By night’s end, 10,000 fans witnessed the most extraordinary concert in the history of hip-hop music. Welcome to “A Wu-Tang Experience.”\n\nCombining performances, interviews and revealing insights from various group members and associates, classical musicians and concertgoers, this feature documents the extraordinary concert at the iconic Red Rocks Amphitheatre where the Wu-Tang Clan, backed by the 60-piece Colorado Symphony Orchestra, weaves together songs from their vast discography of group and solo albums to create a live score to a real-time screening of the seminal martial arts film “The 36th Chamber of Shaolin” — the movie that inspired the Clan’s aesthetic and the title of their groundbreaking debut album “Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers).” Through exploring the question of whether hip-hop has earned the legitimacy of more established and prestigious musical genres, “A Wu-Tang Experience” delivers answers that inform, reveal and inspire.",

      "content": "Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country on 5 August 2024 after spending almost 16 years in office. Hasina had ordered a violent crackdown on student protests, but ultimately the uprising led to the toppling of the authoritarian leader.\n\nWhen Bangladesh’s longest serving prime minister came to power, she awakened hopes with her drive to free millions of people from extreme poverty by liberalizing the economy. But the country’s ‘Iron Lady’ became increasingly autocratic, and created a personality cult based around her long-dead father Sheikh Mujibur, the ‘Father of the Nation’, and forced political opponents and critical journalists and artists into exile. \n\nThe protests began with student demonstrations against a controversial government job quota. Gen Z college students managed to organize broad resistance to the system reserving 30% of civil service posts for the descendants of freedom fighters from the 1971 War of Independence. In the ensuing crackdown, more than 600 people died, many more were injured, and many disappeared. \n\nWhat will it take to rebuild the nation after the July Revolution? This documentary film follows the leaders of the student movement, members of the interim government and victims of the former regime.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Most importantly, she has accomplished all of this by marrying her two passions in life—her family and food—to create multiple culinary endeavors alongside her two children, Joseph and Tanya.\n\nLidia’s love of food, cooking, and its ability to connect family and friends was nurtured as a child in Pola, a small city on the Istrian Peninsula of what was then Yugoslavia. Lidia and her family were forced to flee the communist regime. After a dramatic escape that involved temporary separation from her father in Italy, they registered as refugees and lived in a refugee camp in Italy before they were resettled in the United States when Lidia was eleven. It was here that Lidia's culinary journey took flight, influenced by her experiences and the diverse cultures she encountered. Her cooking style is a tribute to her grandmother Rosa's farm-to-table approach, Aunt Nina's sophisticated techniques in Trieste, and the commercial cooking skills she acquired in a refugee camp kitchen.\n\nLidia has published numerous cookbooks, co-authored with her daughter Tanya, and companion books to her Emmy-winning television series Lidia’s Kitchen, Lidia’s Italy in America, and Lidia’s Italy. Her most recent book is Lidia’s From Our Family Table to Yours which was released in October 2023, a companion to her new 26-part public television series, Lidia’s Kitchen. She is also the author of the English and Italian version of her memoir: My American Dream: A Life of Love, Family, and Food. Lidia’s cooking shows air nationwide in the U.S. on public television and CREATE, internationally, and on various digital networks including Amazon Prime, Tubitv, and Xumo. Her cooking segments are also part of her TUTTOLIDIA YouTube channel.\n\nLidia is a celebrated chef and restaurateur and a founder of Eataly. Together with Tanya and son-in-law Corrado, she also developed a line of all-natural sauces called LIDIA’S. In March 2023, she released a line of cookware with HSN.\n\nLidia is a member of Les Dames D’Escoffier and founding member of Women Chefs and Restaurateurs, two non-profit organizations of women leaders in the food and hospitality industries. She is also a champion for the United Nations Association of the United States of America’s Adopt-A-Future program, in support of refugee education.\n\nAmong the numerous awards and accolades Lidia has earned are seven James Beard Awards (Outstanding Chef, Television Food Show, Best Chefs in America, Who’s Who of Food & Beverage in America, Specials 2016, Special 2017 and 2018) and two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Culinary Host (2013 and 2018). In 2022 Lidia received the Silver Award from APT for 25 years on Public Television.",

Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate​\n\nOffering a comprehensive look at Xi’s vision for China and the broader implications — from his crackdown on Muslims in Xinjiang to his provocative ambitions for Taiwan — “China, the U.S. & the Rise of Xi Jinping” also probes the state of China’s economy and its trade war with the U.S., the hostile China-U.S. relationship, the ramifications and what may come next.\n\nWith China largely shutting out the international media, the two-hour documentary draws on interviews with former Chinese Communist Party members, exiled human rights and democracy activists, academics, authors and journalists to trace the events that shaped President Xi. It examines the trajectory of his life, from being sent to the countryside to perform hard labor during the Maoist revolution, to his embrace of the Chinese Communist Party and his rise through its leadership, to how he has tightened his grip throughout his presidency.\n\n“China, the U.S. & the Rise of Xi Jinping” is a FRONTLINE production with RAIN Media, Inc.

      "content": "When the body of six-year-old JonBenét Ramsey was found in the basement of her Boulder, Colorado, home in the winter of 1996, her murder captivated and horrified the US. The tragic and premature death of a young girl, the investigative errors associated with the case, the false confession from a would-be killer, the conspiracy theories about who the killer really is, and the odd behavior of her family make it one of the most famous and widely speculated-upon crimes of the 20th century. Nobody has ever been convicted of Ramsey's murder.\n\nTo read more about this wild case, go here:\nhttps://www.ranker.com/list/jonbenet-ramsey-family-facts/patrick-thornton?ref=lists_about&pos=1\n\nBe sure to subscribe to the Weird History Newsletter: https://www.ranker.com/newsletters/weird-history?utm_source=Youtube&utm_medium=WeirdHistory&utm_campaign=WHnewsletters&utm_content=description_box\n\n#jonbenetramsey #unsolvedmystery #weirdhistory",

The announcement was broadcast across the British Empire: Independence of India within the next few months; the nation was to be divided. The new border ran through villages and towns, through families and religious sites. In the months following the announcement, the country witnessed one of the largest mass migration in human history, and some of the worst violence of the bloody 20th century.  Since 1947, several wars have been fought over this border, and tensions still exist today between these two nuclear-armed neighbours.  If Partition was destined to be so disastrous, why did it happen? Who made this decision? And how did it go so wrong? \n\nFILM ARCHIVE\nView and licence the archive film used in this video: https://film.iwmcollections.org.uk/collections/5188\n\nCREDITS\nWith thanks to Andrew Whitehead and his interviewees from the project Partition Voices, the testimonies heard in this video.

      "content": "Bhutan is famous as the ‘land of happiness’ in the Himalayas. But little is known about the country’s subtropical South. This film explores the little-known region, where people live according to ancient traditions and maintain close-knit communities.\n\nThe landscape in Bhutan’s South is characterized by dense jungle, unique biodiversity and mainly Hindu communities. In places that don’t get many visitors, it’s possible to get a sense of what life in the lowlands of Bhutan at the foot of the mighty mountain range is all about: community and togetherness.\n\nEven though education and healthcare are free, there’s no state welfare. Support is provided by society, instead. Far away from the urban centers, the documentary accompanies people who know how to help themselves in times of need. Like dentist Tenzin, who treats people in remote mountain villages free of charge. The documentary also shows the healing rituals of Bhutan's youngest shaman: 16-year-old Suresh feels he has been chosen to mediate between the living and the dead. He left school at the age 12 to pursue this calling.\n\nIn the heart of the jungle, shop owner Rinzin waits eagerly to be connected to the power grid and the Internet. The mother-to-be hopes this will not only make life easier for her, thanks to a fridge and rice cooker, but will also improve her children's education.\n\nMany of Bhutan's traditions and customs are little-known. Many people here have a profound compassion: not only for their fellow human beings, but also for animals. Following an old Buddhist practice, the devout Sonam tries to save thousands of fish. Sonam is convinced that this is the only way he can preserve Bhutan's spiritual heritage and follow the path of Buddha.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

He also drew muscles, bones, and organs, and experimented with different techniques. He even studied ancient sources, which led to his famous depiction of The Vitruvian Man.\n\nThis program is made possible by viewers like you.

      "content": "An HIV-positive diagnosis is something people still hide, today. In this film, people in Ireland living with HIV share their experiences - some for the first time on camera - with emotional candor, using a variety of means.\n\nRobbie Lawlor was diagnosed with HIV at the age of 21 and was one of the youngest people to come out on Irish television. Enda McGrattan, aka Veda, promised to keep his HIV infection a secret for a decade, but finally came out by releasing a song. And a group of Irish women and migrants who cannot show their faces have nonetheless found creative ways to make their voices heard... \nBased on a theater performance, the film was made by directing duo Anna Rodgers and Shaun Dunne. They used documentary film, performance and cross-genre storytelling techniques to make the protagonists’ stories tangible. Using archive material and re-enactment, the queer Irish icon Thom McGinty, aka \"The Diceman”, who was one of the first in Ireland to speak openly about their AIDS illness, is also honored.\nExploring social stigma and the art of storytelling, this film highlights the experiences of people living with HIV in Ireland today.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Dan Snow joins professional yachtsman and adventurer Conrad Humphreys as they tour the beautiful, rugged Isles of Scilly, on the wave-lashed shores of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIn the first episode, Dan and Conrad navigate the ancient history of this remote archipelago on the edge of Britain, discovering burial mounds built thousands of years ago, and an Iron Age village that thrived here when the Romans ruled Europe. Sailing in Conrad’s beautiful replica 18th century boat, “Bounty’s End”, they weave their way through a wonderland of history and legend.\n\nIn the second episode, the intrepid pair navigate through these notoriously treacherous waters to investigate stories of shipwrecks and an infamous maritime disaster that changed the history of navigation and unlocked the secrets of longitude!\n\nIn the third and final episode, Dan and Conrad conclude their epic expedition around the Isles of Scilly exploring the impressive defences that line the islands’ coastlines that made them almost impregnable - guarding the Atlantic approaches.\n\nFor hundreds of years, military planners have recognised the strategic importance of the Isles of Scilly. The island’s position at the crossroads of several important sea routes made them a vital asset for Britain.\n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.

It’s not even past. –William Faulkner\n\nMost developers pursue the Latest and Greatest with intense fervor, yet the history of engineering, including software projects, contains rich lessons that we risk repeating ad nauseam. This session recounts a variety of stories of projects that failed…and why. Ranging from the Vasa in 1628 to Knight Capital in 2012, each story tells of a mistaken interpretation of some architectural fundamental principle and the consequences–some good, some less so. I also look at the common threads for these stories, which resonates with problems many companies have but don’t realize.

But this is also where the migration routes of the Nenets run. Is their habitat being destroyed?\n\nThe Nenets are nomadic reindeer herders. They have inhabited the Yamal Peninsula in western Siberia for more than 200 generations, traveling with their herds across the barren landscape in search of food for their animals. But since the discovery of massive natural gas deposits there, their habitat is under threat. Companies including Novatek, Total and the Chinese National Petroleum Corporation have flocked to the region. Towns have been built, as well as a railway line and an airport. Nuclear-powered icebreakers head for the remote region and boreholes crisscross the landscape. All of this leaves its mark on the local ecosystem. It also accelerates climate change. The permafrost is already thawing. Extreme weather is increasing. Climate conditions have become almost impossible to predict. All of this makes nomadic life almost impossible. \n\nThe gas deposits have made the region rich. But the Nenets see little benefit. An estimated 70 percent of the indigenous population live below the poverty line. The Nenets are not complaining. They know that they would lose a fight against the government. They are trying to adapt. But at what cost? And for how long can they preserve their ancient way of life? \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Just as the central scene of Leonardo’s mural started to take shape, he stopped – abandoning yet another commission. It’s unlikely Michelangelo ever began his mural.\n\nThis program is made possible by viewers like you.

      "content": "Experts estimate that Europe’s dog mafia makes around a billion Euros every year. Birgitt Thiesmann from the animal welfare foundation \"Four Paws” fights against the illegal puppy trade.\n\nThe activist follows the trail of this business all over Europe. She talks to animal sanctuaries, police, vets and duped buyers. \"I’ve been physically attacked and of course, you receive threats,” says Birgitt Thiesmann, \"that’s just simply part of the job.” For more than 20 years, Birgitt worked as a reporter for the German youth magazine \"Bravo”. After writing a reportage on the illegal puppy trade in Europe, she joined \"Four Paws\". Since then, she’s been part of the fight against criminal traders. Experts estimate they earn around one billion Euros selling puppies in Europe. This makes the illegal puppy trade just as lucrative as the criminal trade in drugs, weapons or women.\n\n\"The puppies are usually terminally ill. They’re not vaccinated or wormed and many of them die straight after they’ve been sold,” says Birgitt, who maintains contact with many duped and shocked buyers. She regularly follows the tracks left by criminal puppy traders across the continent. In Prague, she meets someone who quit the business. The woman used to be what’s known as a \"multiplier” - animal activists describe these outfits as \"puppy mills” and never as \"breeding”. Birgitt’s hoping to glean some new insider information and isn’t disappointed: she hears about another, so far undiscovered \"multiplier station” not far from Prague. \"This has nothing at all to do with responsible breeding,” says Birgitt.\n\nShe sees the consequences all over Europe: overcrowded animal shelters in Germany and puppies displaying challenging behavior in the kennels of Belgian dog handlers.

This struggle often leads to decreased innovation and agility, hindering business growth and competitiveness.\n\nEvent-driven architecture (EDA) offers a powerful solution that extends beyond the traditional roles of producers, consumers, and brokers. It facilitates the creation of dynamic architectures that evolve, empower teams, and enhance agility, enabling businesses to thrive in rapidly changing environments.\n\nThis talk delves into how complexity can obscure the potential of event-driven architecture (EDA). We'll investigate how EDA contributes to the growth of evolutionary architectures and discuss the guardrails and governance strategies needed to manage complexity and fully harness EDA's potential.\n\nWhether you're improving your current architecture or embarking on a new journey, this session will offer actionable insights into controlling complexity and help you realize the potential of event-driven architectures.

      "content": "Spanish farmer Antonio Basa is has to guard his olive grove at night. Heat-related crop failures have driven the price of olive oil sky high and now, professional gangs are stealing the lucrative fruit.\n\nSpain is the world’s largest producer of olive oil. Antonio Basa rubs his tired eyes after a night patrolling his fields. \"By day, we’re working hard in the groves and by night, we’re back out there making sure our olives aren’t stolen - it’s so frustrating,” he says. The thieves are getting bolder and harvesting many tons of olives every night. The olive shortage is making crops more valuable as extreme drought reduced the 2022 and 2023 harvests by around half.\n\nJosé Medina from Zafra was the victim of four break-ins last year. Olive oil valued at 80,000 Euros was stolen from his warehouse. Insurers won’t pay out, forcing José to the brink of bankruptcy. He’s also angered by the slow progress of the investigation into the crime. José has long given up hope that the perpetrators will ever be brought to justice.\n\nFran Camorra from the Guardia Civil understands the frustration. He’s a member of the force’s nature protection unit \"Seprona” and estimates that justice is served in no more than 10 percent of cases like these, although his department now patrols olive groves itself with motorbikes, drones, and thermal imaging cameras. But it’s not possible to monitor all the groves in Spain. Antonio Basa is seriously considering giving up. After all, on the back of two extreme droughts, thieves are now threatening his livelihood.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

      "content": "Desserts at restaurants have gotten boring — here’s why.\n\nThis video is presented by Bluehost. Bluehost doesn’t influence our editorial decisions, but they make videos like this possible.\n\nWhen choosing a restaurant you probably look at a few things: What type of food do they serve? How close is it? Maybe if they’re allergen- or kid-friendly. You’re very likely looking at the list of entrees available to see if anything strikes you before even making a reservation. It’s a pretty typical way to choose a restaurant. After all, you want to enjoy your night out. But chef-instructor Kathryn Gordon from the Institute of Culinary Education in New York has one more suggestion: “I think you should try to look at the dessert menu more.”\n\nDesserts at most restaurants have gotten boring. You might find an incredible blend of cocktails or a wide-ranging wine list, followed by a well-curated list of sharable plates for appetizers, and of course the entrees will almost always offer some sort of wow factor. Oftentimes, dessert isn’t even on the main menu. Even the menu itself can feel like an afterthought — and when it hits the table, you’re likely staring down the same options you’ve seen hundreds of times before. There’s a reason for this.

That decade brought to life classic unsolved cases such as the murder of Elizabeth Short in The Black Dahlia and the search for the Zodiac Killer in Zodiac. Serial killers were also brought to the big screen such as the story of Aileen Wuornos in Monster and Jeffrey Dahmer in Dahmer, both of which stirred controversy. Although these films may at times stretch the truth, they largely stick to the facts, which are indeed stranger than fiction in most cases. Which are still worth watching decades later, and which are best left forgotten?\n\nTo read more about great movies based off true incidents, go here:\nhttps://www.ranker.com/list/necromancy-facts/jen-jeffers\n\nBe sure to subscribe to the Weird History Newsletter: https://www.ranker.com/newsletters/weird-history?utm_source=Youtube&utm_medium=WeirdHistory&utm_campaign=WHnewsletters&utm_content=description_box\n\n#movies  #truestories #weirdhistory",

      "content": "In the Mexican city of Juchitán, women run the economy and organize communal life. It’s one of the few places where matriarchal structures survive. The Juchitec matriarchy is a legacy of the Zapotec civilization.\n\nIn a film from the 1930s, the Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein documented the life of the Zapotecs - self-determined women who worked as traders, kept stores of gold and chose their own husbands. This matriarchy where women wield the economic power and run public life was a legacy of the more than 2,500-year-old Zapotec culture. What’s left of this a century later, in a nation well-known for its machismo culture?\nZapotec women live in the southern Mexican city of Juchitán, in a region that thrives on exchange between North and South, between the Pacific and the Atlantic. Here, the women have always done the trading. Lola took over her mother’s store selling traditional items of clothing. In 2017, an earthquake hit the region and destroyed the market, the beating heart of the city. The catastrophe also jeopardized the power of Zapotec women. With the support of her two daughters Paulina and Marisela, Lola and the other market traders were able to get back to work. Together they were once again able to organize what’s always been a motor of their redistribution economy: Festivals.\n600 festivals are celebrated in the city every year, with women as the focal point. In a few days’ time it’ll be Jade’s 15th birthday marking her entry into this community of women. Her mother Ana Lilia, also a market trader, has been saving up for this event for months and wants everything to be perfect. Her muxe friend Coral helps her with the decorations made from thousands of colored cut-out pieces of paper.\nIn Juchitán, muxes identify as people of the third gender. They are born male and assume women’s roles in the family and within society. Once a year, a church mass is held in honor of the more than 4,000 muxes - a unique event in Mexico. With every day and every festival, the Zapotec women of Juchitán defy the prevailing machismo in Mexico and fight to sustain their tradition.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The most significant British naval helicopter in the last 60 years. What makes the Sea King stand out from other helicopters is its sheer versatility and adaptability. Over almost fifty years of service with the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force from 1969-2018, the Sea King was used in numerous roles, well beyond its original design as an anti-submarine warfare helicopter. It was what is known as a ‘utility helicopter’ – an aircraft designed for multiple tasks. It saw service as a ‘commando’ troop carrier, a heavy lift transport, an anti-ship helicopter, an airborne early warning aircraft, and even a search and rescue helicopter. It was truly the ‘Swiss army knife’ of naval and military helicopters.\n\nExplore and licence the film clips used in this video: https://film.iwmcollections.org.uk/collections/_majVRGad\n\nFollow IWM on social media:\nx.com/I_W_M\ninstagram.com/imperialwarmuseums\nfacebook.com/iwm.london\n\nAttributions:\n\nAgusta Westland HH-101A Caesar: Gian Marco Anzellotti https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:AgustaWestland_HH-101A_Caesar_(cropped).jpg\n\nThumbnail image: Mez Merrill https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Royal_Navy_Seaking_Mk4_Helicopter_Over_Northern_Norway_MOD_45156765.jpg",

      "content": "One of the most famous paintings by Vincent van Gogh was sold at auction in 1990 - before disappearing without trace. What has happened to it? The search has taken investigators from the US, to France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\n\nSix weeks before his death in 1890, van Gogh painted a portrait of his physician Paul Ferdinand Gachet. The doctor’s melancholic demeanor, described by the artist himself as \"the heartbroken expression of our time”, has afforded the work iconic status.\n\nIn 1990, 100 years after its creation, the portrait was auctioned in New York for 82 million US Dollars, the highest price ever paid for a work of art at the time. Then, it disappeared into private ownership. Where is it now? Those who know the answer aren’t willing to talk.\n\nIn pursuing leads as to the whereabouts of the work, this documentary not only explores the excesses of the global art trade, it also sheds light on the emotional connections that people have formed with the portrait.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Asma discovers the prejudice faced by South Asians of all religions traveling to America in the early part of the 20th century and the race-based naturalization and immigration laws that shaped their lives. She also discovers how Mir Dad joined a growing number of South Asian and Mexican American couples who built their lives together in the 1920s and 30s, forming blended communities whose descendants still treasure their mixed heritage today.

How can we write better user stories and avoid these common mistakes? \n\nRequirements vs User Story Requirements, are they the same, are user story requirements a thing? There are really only three steps in building software, having an idea of the problem that we’d like to solve, building some software to solve it and then checking that the software does what we think and solves the problem. A User Story is focused on the first step, but if we get them right they make the next two steps much easier. \n\nIn this episode Dave Farley explores 5 common user story mistakes that make software engineering and continuous delivery more difficult, rather than easier. During his exploration of the mistakes, Dave describes some of the properties of better, more useful, user stories and the reasons why they are better.\n\nCD TRAINING COURSES\nIf you want to learn Continuous Delivery and DevOps skills, check out Dave Farley's courses\nhttps://bit.ly/DFTraining \n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS & LINKS\nYou can grab Dave Farley's new book 'Continuous Delivery Pipelines' here:\nhttps://leanpub.com/cd-pipelines\nDavid Farley • Modern Software Engineering • https://amzn.to/3GI468M\nDave Farley & Jez Humble • Continuous Delivery • https://amzn.to/3ocIHwd\nForsgren, Humble & Kim • Accelerate • https://amzn.to/367RI5o\nGojko Adzic & David Evans • 50 Quick Ideas to Improve your User Stories • https://leanpub.com/50quickideas\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#GOTOxDaveFarley #UserStories #StoryMistakes #Requirements #Programming #DaveFarley #GOTO #GOTOcon #Complexity  #ProgrammingTutorial #SoftwareEngineering\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos & other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!
