For the past thirty years the space programs of many nations have been sending landed platforms of increasing complexity, revealing the Red Planet‚Äôs ancient past. One of the most challenging aspects of all missions to Mars is the ability to achieve a safe landing on the surface, from an initial entry speed of 30,000 miles per hour to a soft touchdown. During the descent to the surface robots and eventually people must be protected from extreme temperatures and G-forces by complex engineered systems. On the surface they must be able to survive radiation and low pressures, with only the limited resources they can bring with them.\n\nThis talk will discuss the motivation for Mars exploration and how engineering challenges are tackled with computational modeling, cutting-edge technologies, and out-of-the-box thinking. Engineering the Red Planet is the key to our future and understanding our past.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nNASA ‚Ä¢ NASA Systems Engineering Handbook ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3FWjqhR\nBernice Kastner ‚Ä¢ Space Mathematics ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3oQCDKF\nKellie Gerardi ‚Ä¢ Not Necessarily Rocket Science ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3CW4HS9\nPiers Bizony & Roger D.

It is a whole-team approach to doing all the work the team does including designing, coding, testing, and working with the customers, users and other stakeholders. This is an evolutionary step beyond pair programming and accentuates face-to-face communication, team alignment, collaboration, and self-organizing team concepts of the Agile approach to software development.\n\nMob Programming can be a highly effective approach to software development. There are numerous teams doing Mob Programming all over the world, including distributed teams, and there have been a number of positive reports of success. Please join me as I share how the concept got started, the benefits, techniques we use, and some of the problems we've faced.\n\nStructure This presentation provides a description of Mob Programming, how is came to be, the benefits we've seen, and some tips on how to do it yourself. It is presented as a talk with slides, with some audience participation.\n\nLearning outcome You will learn enough to try this out on your own with your team or with some friends.

Is it a political ideology that we‚Äôll reckon with for years to come, or just a collection of whims from the most powerful man in the world? And what does it mean for the country‚Äôs political future?\n\nBeauchamp is the author of The Reactionary Spirit: How America's Most Insidious Political Tradition Swept the World.

His message: Stop eating meat, cook with soy!\n\nIn his church in the megacity of Barquisimeto in northern Venezuela, a Catholic priest gives cooking classes. He wants to show how soy can replace meat in almost every dish. But he is not motivated by veganism or a change in diet due to climate change. Jose Maria simply wants to ensure that the children in the slums are well fed. Dried soy is rich in protein and can help prevent malnutrition. It's inexpensive, which is crucial in a country hit hard by inflation.

Fishing crews in the EU earn around ‚Ç¨12 per kilogram of shark fin. But in Asia, where shark fin soup is a delicacy, prices for customers can reach ‚Ç¨1,500.\n\nIn Europe, the biggest trade in sharks is done by companies in Vigo, on Spain's Atlantic coast. The tons of shark meat found on sale there by marine biologist Lukas M√ºller are mainly from young animals not yet old enough to have reproduced. Meanwhile, the Stop Finning campaign has collected over one million petition signatures, and is forcing the European Commission to address the issue. Activists want an EU-wide ban on the shark fin trade. But for many people in Vigo, fishing is their livelihood. \n\nThis film exposes Europe's shark trade and the effects it has on marine ecosystems.

However, as the number of APIs continues to grow exponentially, managing their interop and governing their compliance becomes a critical challenge. Traditional API governance approaches are usually relying on manual processes and often lag behind development cycles, leading to release delays, inconsistencies, and increased technical debt.\n\nThis real-world experience report will share a set of transformative strategies that helped us elevate our DevEx by an order of magnitude, while simultaneously helping us shorten our cycle times by 50%.\n\nWe delve into the principles of \"shift-left\" API governance, a proactive approach that integrates governance early in the development cycle, ensuring faster, more secure, and compliant API integrations. By starting with a collaborative API Design first approach followed by contract testing in service provider's CI pipeline, teams can identify and mitigate risks sooner, streamline workflows, and foster a culture of collaboration, accountability and innovation. This helps them unlock unprecedented developer productivity and accelerate their release cycles.\n\nKey highlights of the talk include:\n‚Ä¢ Exponential Improvement in DevEx: Learn how to enhance API development using industry-leading tools and processes that result in a 10x improvement in developer satisfaction and productivity.\n‚Ä¢ Shift-Left Governance: Discover the mechanics of implementing shift-left practices in API governance, enabling earlier detection of integration issues, reduced rework, and accelerated time-to-market.\n‚Ä¢ Halving Cycle Time: Uncover the strategic and technical adjustments necessary to reduce cycle times by 50%, transforming the speed at which products reach the market without compromising quality.\n‚Ä¢ Real-World Applications: Gain insights from successful real world implementations where these principles have been applied, showcasing tangible outcomes and lessons learned.\n‚Ä¢ Future-Proofing Your API Strategy: Equip yourself with the knowledge to not only improve current processes but also to adapt to future challenges and opportunities in API development.\n\nJoin us for an enlightening session that promises not only to inspire but also to equip you with practical tools, practices and insights to revolutionize your API design, development and governance strategy. Whether you're a developer, a technical leader, or a product manager, this talk will provide valuable perspectives on enhancing DevEx, streamlining governance, and achieving remarkable efficiency gains.

For some, like prominent activist Mazen Al-Hamada, help arrived too late. He is believed to have been executed shortly before the regime‚Äôs collapse. \n\nHis body was reportedly found at a morgue in the Harasta Hospital, linked to the notorious Sednaya prison, also known as ‚Äúthe human slaughterhouse‚Äù.  The Assad regime disposed of inmates' bodies at the hospital‚Äôs morgue before burying them in mass graves. Mazen‚Äôs body had visible signs of torture and beatings, according to reports. \n\nSince 2011, after a series of protests broke out in Syria, tens of thousands of men, women and children had been forcefully disappeared into secret detention centers. Survivors accuse the regime of crimes against humanity. \n\nThis documentary, first released in 2017, sheds light on the brutality of Syria‚Äôs fallen regime. In it, Mazen Al-Hamada shares his accounts of his first imprisonment between the years 2012 and 2013. Survivors of the prisons and the families of other victims recount their pain and despair. \n\nBill Wiley and his team of war crime investigators smuggled material out of Syria to a secret location in Europe. They extracted around 600,000 pages of official government documents ‚Äì a wealth of potential evidence against the Assad regime that could help build the case for a criminal prosecution along the lines of the Nuremberg trials. The paper trail led the prosecutors to the fate of the protestors who took to the streets in 2011. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #syria #assad \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Then, you remember you‚Äôre also a software engineer, and the solution becomes suddenly obvious. Join me in this session, where I'll demonstrate how I enhanced my music composition process by harnessing the power of Java and AI.\n\nThis presentation will discuss the core architectural patterns for introducing AI capabilities into an existing software system, exploring concepts like templated prompts, agent tools, and integration of external knowledge. The Java ecosystem is getting more and more capabilities for building AI applications. But are they ready for production? Are there any gaps?\n\nThroughout the session, I‚Äôll build a \"composer assistant\" application using Java and an AI Orchestrator (LangChain4J, Spring AI) to showcase how to make an LLM application production-ready. Is the developer experience affected when working locally with language models? How is observability different when it comes to tokens? Can we ensure resilience across the many integrations orchestrated by the AI? What strategies are available for deploying LLM applications?\n\nIn a final twist, you‚Äôll choose which movie scene to score, and I‚Äôll compose and perform the music live for it, supported by AI. Will it meet the mark? There‚Äôs only one way to find out: join me in exploring the practical side of AI applications, where Java and Generative AI offer tangible solutions to real-world use cases.

That‚Äôs why tobacco multinationals are increasingly focused on e-cigarettes, enticing consumers with bright colors and fruity flavors. The target group: young people.\n\nThe World Health Organization says smoking results in the death of eight million people every year. That‚Äôs one reason why you‚Äôll now often hear tobacco companies promoting the switch to e-cigarettes, with claims that these are less harmful to our health. It‚Äôs first and foremost young people who believe the industry‚Äôs promises, thereby taking the first step on the road to addiction. After all, nicotine is an addictive substance. And although it may taste better than tobacco, puffing on a vape is still going to get you hooked in precisely the same way as smoking a regular cigarette. The film investigates the cynicism of an industry that not only accepts this, but also deliberately aims for it.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

In the very first days of the war, Russian troops occupied the exclusion zone around what‚Äôs left of Chernobyl. Shortly afterwards, they took control of Zaporizhzhia‚Äôs nuclear power plant.\n\nRussian troops withdrew from Chernobyl after a few weeks. But Zaporizhzhia, Europe's largest nuclear power plant, has effectively been occupied since March 2022. The plant has come under frequent attack, the power supply has been interrupted and fires have broken out. Experts have repeatedly warned of a possible nuclear disaster. How safe are nuclear power plants in a time of war? And how is the Russian occupation affecting the nuclear plant‚Äôs Ukrainian employees? What can the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) do? \n\nThe documentary follows three employees of Ukrainian nuclear power plants and describes the consequences of the Russian occupation. These include fear, illegal interrogations and torture. For IAEA chief Rafael Grossi, staff working conditions are the biggest cause for concern. \n\nDirector Pavlo Cherepin‚Äôs involvement in the film brought back personal memories. He learned the word evacuation early in his childhood, following the Chernobyl reactor accident. One of the worst nuclear disasters in history, Chernobyl has not been forgotten here in Ukraine -- a country that renounced nuclear weapons in 1994 in return for security guarantees.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #russiaukrainewar #russia #ukraine \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

A civilization's plumbing can teach us about the diets they ate, the diseases they contracted, how they conducted civil engineering projects, and possibly even what their attitudes about bathrooms were. \n\nBut our information about ancient bathrooms and toilets is still fairly new, especially when it comes to ancient Rome. Until recently, the bathroom habits of the ancients weren't considered an appropriate subject for academic study. When previous archaeologists did unearth ancient toilets, they came up with fantastical alternate reasons for their uses to avoid describing how they were actually used. When Italian excavator Giacomo Boni discovered a Roman toilet in 1913, he imagined that it was a water pump that powered the entire house. \n\nTo  read more about Roman toilets and plumbing, go here:\nhttps://www.ranker.com/list/ancient-roman-toilets-history/jim-rowley\n\nBe sure to subscribe to the Weird History Newsletter: https://www.ranker.com/newsletters/weird-history?utm_source=Youtube&utm_medium=WeirdHistory&utm_campaign=WHnewsletters&utm_content=description_box\n\n#ancientrome #plumbing #weirdhistory","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/9HaCRGeolMc?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Coping with dementia - The challenges families face | DW Documentary","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW2m73vJKps","date":1734282041,"author":"DW Documentary","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"What kind of environment is the right one for people with dementia? The film explores new ways to provide more appropriate care to sufferers of this disease.\n\nDementia is a disease that not only torments those affected, but also often puts relationships with loved ones under severe strain. 1.8 million people in Germany suffer from dementia. It‚Äôs estimated that by 2050, that figure could rise to more than 2.8 million. The question of appropriate and, above all, humane care is becoming increasingly urgent. Most dementia sufferers are accommodated in care homes. However, this is often not the best concept, due to a shortage of skilled nursing staff and other factors. What is needed are places where people can feel safe and secure.\n\nIn this report, we meet people with first-hand experience of dementia - like Julia Bernsee, whose mother was diagnosed with the disease in 2019. Her mother was able to stay at home initially, but then Julia took her into her own home. When her mother spent some time in a nursing home, Julia was alarmed at the realities of care in such places. This is because dementia patients are often sedated with medication. But then Julia found a new facility.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #dementia \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
