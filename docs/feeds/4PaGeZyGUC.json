Jacobs‚Äô horror story, ‚ÄúThe Monkey‚Äôs Paw,‚Äù about an artifact that grants wishes ‚Äî with great consequences.\n\n--\n\nSergeant-Major Morris regaled his friends with epic tales from faraway lands‚Äî until one asked about an artifact the Sergeant had alluded to. Slowly, he produced the object: a mummified monkey‚Äôs paw. He explained that a holy man had imbued the paw with the power to grant three wishes to three men. But each wish comes with chilling consequences. Iseult Gillespie shares the tale of the monkey‚Äôs paw.\n\nLesson by Iseult Gillespie, directed by Kayu Leung.\n\nSupport Our Non-Profit Mission\n----------------------------------------------\nSupport us on Patreon: http://bit.ly/TEDEdPatreon\nCheck out our merch: http://bit.ly/TEDEDShop\n----------------------------------------------\n\nConnect With Us\n----------------------------------------------\nSign up for our newsletter: http://bit.ly/TEDEdNewsletter\nFollow us on Facebook: http://bit.ly/TEDEdFacebook\nFind us on Twitter: http://bit.ly/TEDEdTwitter\nPeep us on Instagram: http://bit.ly/TEDEdInstagram\n----------------------------------------------\n\nKeep Learning\n----------------------------------------------\nView full lesson: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-curse-of-the-monkeys-paw-iseult-gillespie\nDig deeper with additional resources: https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-curse-of-the-monkeys-paw-iseult-gillespie/digdeeper\n\nAnimator's website: https://linktr.ee/kayu.caillou.leung   \nMusic: https://linktr.ee/redstems  \nSound design: https://soundgoods.tv\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThank you so much to our patrons for your support!

Truman, the 33rd U.S. President. He focuses on the chilling meeting between Truman and the psychologically traumatised physicist, who worries what he has unleashed by creating the Atomic Bomb. As we'll see, Truman was far from sympathetic. \n\nNext up is 'Thirteen Days' (2000), a drama that focuses on John F. Kennedy's handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962. Often seen as the 35th U.S. President's finest hour, Dan looks to sort fact from fiction as Kennedy and his advisors seek to resolve this existential threat to humanity.\n\nDan then moves onto reviewing Bryan Cranston's depiction of 36th U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson in 'All the Way' (2016), as he strives to push the Civil Rights Bill through the U.S. Senate, before receiving intelligence from Vietnam that would alter the course of his premiership.\n\n'Frost/Nixon' (2008) is the penultimate film, starring Martin Sheen and Frank Langella, which sees UK chat show host David Frost interview Richard M. Nixon in an unlikely turn of events. What might initially seem as an easy opportunity for the 37th U.S. President to set the record straight on the Watergate Scandal soon turns into a metaphorical boxing match between the interviewer and disgraced former president.\n\nLastly, Dan watches Adam McKay's 'Vice' (2018), starring Christian Bale as 43rd U.S. President, George W. Bush's infamous vice-president Dick Cheney. Was Cheney really the puppet master in Bush's administration? Dan gives his thoughts.\n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.

But if you understand what polls are actually capable of telling you, it might dispel any desire you have for them to predict whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump will be the next president. \n\nWe interviewed pollsters about their processes and explained the basics of how they turn small surveys into a way to measure the entirety of a voting population. No matter what measures pollsters take to make their samples as representative as possible, there‚Äôs a limit to how precise they can be.

With contemporary writing and expert historians on hand he walks in the footsteps of what's now remembered as the Varian disaster.\n\nIn the early first century the Romans saw Germania as a land of forests and swamps full of backwards people, a place easy for them to conquer and control for their growing empire. German tribes were paying taxes, giving tributes and sending their high born sons to Rome, it was all going so well‚Ä¶but within this flourishing empire was a growing resentment of ruthless Roman rule.  \n\nIn early 9AD Roman forces led by Roman General Publius Quinctillius Varus crossed into the area of Germania run by the Cherusci tribe. Luckily for them they had a high profile Cherusci on their side who had been educated in Rome, he was the perfect tamed barbarian, Arminius. Arminus would be their guide to all things Cherusci, helping negotiate trade deals with the area‚Äôs Germanic tribes and ensuring safe passage throughout Barbaricium. \n\nTo control this potentially hostile area, Varus and Arminius were aided by three legions, roughly 15,000 men, who were highly efficient trained killers. By Summer this team of Cherusci and Roman‚Äôs had hacked their way further into the heartlands of Barbaricium, spending time in ‚Äòfriendly‚Äô territory‚Ä¶but little did they know there was a traitor in their midst‚Ä¶Arminius aided by thousands of Germans had a plan that was about to change Roman history‚Ä¶forever! \n\nAt the end of the summer Varus and his men were dismantling their camp ready for a return to the safety of the Rhine, but shock erupted through the camp as news broke of an uprising. A group of Germans had risen in revolt against Roman rule! \n\nVarus and his legions decided they had one more fight in them before they headed back for a restful winter. They marched into Barbaricum, ready for an easy win against these troublesome Germans. \n\nVarus and his men headed deeper and deeper into Germania unaware of the impending danger that lurked for them within the dense forest ahead.\n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and Terry Crews answer grab bag questions about Mars, magnetic fields, photons, Hot Ones spicy wings and the entropy of muscles. \n\nWe discuss whether we could develop technology to create an artificial magnetic field to shield future Mars colonists. Would living underground on Mars defeat the purpose? They also explore Earth's ever-shifting magnetic poles, what happens when the field weakens, and why humans don‚Äôt have to fear an imminent magnetic flip.\n\nWe explore the balance between muscles and entropy in the universe, examining whether physical strength still has value in today‚Äôs world‚Äîand if muscles are even necessary for space survival. From gamma rays‚Äô interactions with space curvature to the effects of low gravity on human physiology, we touch on how space impacts everything from fitness routines to bone density. They share their experience facing the notorious Hot Ones‚Äô spicy wings challenge and Neil‚Äôs spicy aftermath in his own bathroom.\n\nFinally, Neil and Terry push the limits of our understanding, speculating on what lies beyond the observable universe and why the cosmos may look very different beyond our cosmic horizon. We close with stories from Terry‚Äôs latest projects and his journey to success, sharing wisdom from his memoir Tough. \n\nTimestamps: \n00:00 - Introduction: Terry Crews\n03:40 - Generating A Magnetic Field on Mars\n07:12 - Earth‚Äôs Flipping Magnetic Poles\n11:44 - The Entropy of Muscles\n16:55 - The Mass Equivalence of Gamma Rays\n21:55 - Skipping Leg Day on a Low-Gravity Planet\n25:13 - If Photons Stopped\n27:37 - The Aftermath of Hot Ones\n31:51 - The Edge of the Universe\n37:17 - Closing\n\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

As a big fan of the original Doom, I couldn't understand why people were saying Doom 2016 was like Doom - at all. So, I decided I'd do a fresh playthrough of the first level of both games. The results were more dramatic than I imagined. I could play through OG Doom's E1M1 over THIRTEEN times before I'd finish 2016's first level ONCE. I almost finished Doom's first level entirely before I even opened the first door in 2016. Fully twice before I picked up the 2016 shotgun. Hence; \"A Change of Pace\". \n\nSure, Doom 2016 is a relatively fast-paced shooter compared to many modern FPS games. But I think a lot of people either overlooked, or simply forgot, just how much faster the original Doom was. No tutorials, no cutscenes, no intros, no dialog popups, no RPG elements, no tech trees, no bullshit storyline nobody asked for, and a much more visceral, fast-paced, explosive type of action. In particular, Doom 2016's Glory Kills absolutely killed the pace and flow of that game, compared to the original, where you didn't need such useless (and repetitive) gimmicks, and most importantly, stuff actually DIED when you shot it. 2016's enemies are not only tankier, but are designed in such a way that hits don't kill them, but weaken them, to set them up for Glory Kills instead, something that's utterly not in line with what a true Doom game would be like. The outright killing power of Doom's arsenal is LEGENDARY, after all. \n\nYeah yeah yeah, and for those who asked, I just played it on a normal modern keyboard, one of the Epomaker ones. Maybe someday I'll day a \"Doom on a Doom Era Keyboard\" video with a Model M or something if you guys want :p .","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/3YIQeTrB-nM?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Exploring Our Solar System's Moons | Moon Explorers Full Series | BBC Earth Science","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22VTx1GE5uA","date":1731844802,"author":"BBC Earth Science","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"From searching for life on Jupiter's moon Europa to flying a drone on Saturn's moon Titan, these scientists are striving to answer our questions.

We explore how our gap in understanding leads to common misconceptions, from gambling habits to conspiracy theories around lotteries. Learn about the time a physicist conference went to Las Vegas and wasn‚Äôt invited back. From survival patterns to why we see lions lurking in the grass when none are there, Neil explains how evolution makes us err on the side of caution. \n\nWhy is probability, a fundamental branch of math, still not prioritized in schools? We run through the timeline of the different branches of math. When did humans start taking averages? \n\nWhat is the probability of you being born? We explore the probabilities of life and the statistics you overcome just to exist. We break down the idea of risk and why humans have a hard time wrapping our heads around it. How has the idea of risk changed in the digital age? \n\nCosoi shares insights from years on the cybersecurity front lines, including work with Interpol, and the tactics scammers use, from hacking passwords to creating fake concert tickets. We also get the lowdown on avoiding online threats‚Äîwhy complex passwords might not actually be the best strategy, and why your face or voice recognition software may not be foolproof against hackers in the age of deepfakes.

But the story of how we got here is much more than a simple tale of breakthroughs, genius and men jumping out of baths shouting 'Eureka!' History of Science shows how the political upheavals of history combine with iconic inventions and discoveries, along with the ideas of great thinkers, to create the advances that have transformed our lives. Each episode starts with a disarmingly simple question that everyone asks, and then delves into the past, uncovering human stories and recreating the great experiments of the men and women who sought the answers and, in doing so, changed the world. Discover how science has found out what we are made of; where we came from; and what exists beyond Earth. Find out how science revealed the hidden secrets of nature; how it provided the force to topple kings and emperors; and how it unleashed untold power from within our planet. It's the story of how history made science, and science made history, and how the ideas that emerged made the modern world.\n\nThis is a channel from BBC Studios who help fund new BBC programmes.

Most importantly, she has accomplished all of this by marrying her two passions in life‚Äîher family and food‚Äîto create multiple culinary endeavors alongside her two children, Joseph and Tanya.\n\nLidia‚Äôs love of food, cooking, and its ability to connect family and friends was nurtured as a child in Pola, a small city on the Istrian Peninsula of what was then Yugoslavia. Lidia and her family were forced to flee the communist regime. After a dramatic escape that involved temporary separation from her father in Italy, they registered as refugees and lived in a refugee camp in Italy before they were resettled in the United States when Lidia was eleven. It was here that Lidia's culinary journey took flight, influenced by her experiences and the diverse cultures she encountered. Her cooking style is a tribute to her grandmother Rosa's farm-to-table approach, Aunt Nina's sophisticated techniques in Trieste, and the commercial cooking skills she acquired in a refugee camp kitchen.\n\nLidia has published numerous cookbooks, co-authored with her daughter Tanya, and companion books to her Emmy-winning television series Lidia‚Äôs Kitchen, Lidia‚Äôs Italy in America, and Lidia‚Äôs Italy. Her most recent book is Lidia‚Äôs From Our Family Table to Yours which was released in October 2023, a companion to her new 26-part public television series, Lidia‚Äôs Kitchen. She is also the author of the English and Italian version of her memoir: My American Dream: A Life of Love, Family, and Food. Lidia‚Äôs cooking shows air nationwide in the U.S. on public television and CREATE, internationally, and on various digital networks including Amazon Prime, Tubitv, and Xumo. Her cooking segments are also part of her TUTTOLIDIA YouTube channel.\n\nLidia is a celebrated chef and restaurateur and a founder of Eataly. Together with Tanya and son-in-law Corrado, she also developed a line of all-natural sauces called LIDIA‚ÄôS. In March 2023, she released a line of cookware with HSN.\n\nLidia is a member of Les Dames D‚ÄôEscoffier and founding member of Women Chefs and Restaurateurs, two non-profit organizations of women leaders in the food and hospitality industries. She is also a champion for the United Nations Association of the United States of America‚Äôs Adopt-A-Future program, in support of refugee education.\n\nAmong the numerous awards and accolades Lidia has earned are seven James Beard Awards (Outstanding Chef, Television Food Show, Best Chefs in America, Who‚Äôs Who of Food & Beverage in America, Specials 2016, Special 2017 and 2018) and two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Culinary Host (2013 and 2018). In 2022 Lidia received the Silver Award from APT for 25 years on Public Television.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/SXY91unkds8?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"China, the U.S. & the Rise of Xi Jinping (full documentary) | FRONTLINE","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4ew0cbG1IU","date":1732676442,"author":"FRONTLINE PBS | Official","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"The complex, contentious U.S.-China relationship is a high-profile issue President-elect Donald Trump will face in his second term.

India and Pakistan. The announcement was broadcast across the British Empire: Independence of India within the next few months; the nation was to be divided. The new border ran through villages and towns, through families and religious sites. In the months following the announcement, the country witnessed one of the largest mass migration in human history, and some of the worst violence of the bloody 20th century.  Since 1947, several wars have been fought over this border, and tensions still exist today between these two nuclear-armed neighbours.

Enda McGrattan, aka Veda, promised to keep his HIV infection a secret for a decade, but finally came out by releasing a song. And a group of Irish women and migrants who cannot show their faces have nonetheless found creative ways to make their voices heard... \nBased on a theater performance, the film was made by directing duo Anna Rodgers and Shaun Dunne. They used documentary film, performance and cross-genre storytelling techniques to make the protagonists‚Äô stories tangible. Using archive material and re-enactment, the queer Irish icon Thom McGinty, aka \"The Diceman‚Äù, who was one of the first in Ireland to speak openly about their AIDS illness, is also honored.\nExploring social stigma and the art of storytelling, this film highlights the experiences of people living with HIV in Ireland today.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Sailing in Conrad‚Äôs beautiful replica 18th century boat, ‚ÄúBounty‚Äôs End‚Äù, they weave their way through a wonderland of history and legend.\n\nIn the second episode, the intrepid pair navigate through these notoriously treacherous waters to investigate stories of shipwrecks and an infamous maritime disaster that changed the history of navigation and unlocked the secrets of longitude!\n\nIn the third and final episode, Dan and Conrad conclude their epic expedition around the Isles of Scilly exploring the impressive defences that line the islands‚Äô coastlines that made them almost impregnable - guarding the Atlantic approaches.\n\nFor hundreds of years, military planners have recognised the strategic importance of the Isles of Scilly. The island‚Äôs position at the crossroads of several important sea routes made them a vital asset for Britain.\n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.

It is home to the world's largest natural gas reserves. But this is also where the migration routes of the Nenets run. Is their habitat being destroyed?\n\nThe Nenets are nomadic reindeer herders. They have inhabited the Yamal Peninsula in western Siberia for more than 200 generations, traveling with their herds across the barren landscape in search of food for their animals. But since the discovery of massive natural gas deposits there, their habitat is under threat. Companies including Novatek, Total and the Chinese National Petroleum Corporation have flocked to the region. Towns have been built, as well as a railway line and an airport. Nuclear-powered icebreakers head for the remote region and boreholes crisscross the landscape. All of this leaves its mark on the local ecosystem. It also accelerates climate change. The permafrost is already thawing. Extreme weather is increasing. Climate conditions have become almost impossible to predict. All of this makes nomadic life almost impossible. \n\nThe gas deposits have made the region rich. But the Nenets see little benefit. An estimated 70 percent of the indigenous population live below the poverty line. The Nenets are not complaining. They know that they would lose a fight against the government. They are trying to adapt. But at what cost? And for how long can they preserve their ancient way of life? \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Birgitt Thiesmann from the animal welfare foundation \"Four Paws‚Äù fights against the illegal puppy trade.\n\nThe activist follows the trail of this business all over Europe. She talks to animal sanctuaries, police, vets and duped buyers. \"I‚Äôve been physically attacked and of course, you receive threats,‚Äù says Birgitt Thiesmann, \"that‚Äôs just simply part of the job.‚Äù For more than 20 years, Birgitt worked as a reporter for the German youth magazine \"Bravo‚Äù. After writing a reportage on the illegal puppy trade in Europe, she joined \"Four Paws\". Since then, she‚Äôs been part of the fight against criminal traders. Experts estimate they earn around one billion Euros selling puppies in Europe. This makes the illegal puppy trade just as lucrative as the criminal trade in drugs, weapons or women.\n\n\"The puppies are usually terminally ill. They‚Äôre not vaccinated or wormed and many of them die straight after they‚Äôve been sold,‚Äù says Birgitt, who maintains contact with many duped and shocked buyers. She regularly follows the tracks left by criminal puppy traders across the continent. In Prague, she meets someone who quit the business. The woman used to be what‚Äôs known as a \"multiplier‚Äù - animal activists describe these outfits as \"puppy mills‚Äù and never as \"breeding‚Äù. Birgitt‚Äôs hoping to glean some new insider information and isn‚Äôt disappointed: she hears about another, so far undiscovered \"multiplier station‚Äù not far from Prague. \"This has nothing at all to do with responsible breeding,‚Äù says Birgitt.\n\nShe sees the consequences all over Europe: overcrowded animal shelters in Germany and puppies displaying challenging behavior in the kennels of Belgian dog handlers. Nevertheless: Birgitt and her fellow campaigners are making a difference, albeit on a small scale. Posing as a potential buyer, she tips off vets and the police and catches puppy traders red-handed, confiscating dogs that have evidently been smuggled into Germany. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

This struggle often leads to decreased innovation and agility, hindering business growth and competitiveness.\n\nEvent-driven architecture (EDA) offers a powerful solution that extends beyond the traditional roles of producers, consumers, and brokers. It facilitates the creation of dynamic architectures that evolve, empower teams, and enhance agility, enabling businesses to thrive in rapidly changing environments.\n\nThis talk delves into how complexity can obscure the potential of event-driven architecture (EDA). We'll investigate how EDA contributes to the growth of evolutionary architectures and discuss the guardrails and governance strategies needed to manage complexity and fully harness EDA's potential.\n\nWhether you're improving your current architecture or embarking on a new journey, this session will offer actionable insights into controlling complexity and help you realize the potential of event-driven architectures.

Neil deGrasse Tyson sits down with theoretical physicist and Nobel Laureate Kip Thorne to reflect on discovering gravitational waves with LIGO, the science in the movie Interstellar, black holes, and many more mysteries still yet to be answered.\n\nDiscover the origin story of the movie Interstellar on its 10th anniversary. Kip explains how science, not fiction, shaped the film‚Äôs narrative‚Äîfrom the colossal waves on Miller‚Äôs planet to the physics behind black hole time dilation. Discover the recipe for how to create a wormhole and how turning on a time machine could cause it to self-destruct. Plus, learn about the Casimir effect, exotic particles, and how LIGO manipulated vacuum fluctuations to bypass the uncertainty principle. \n\nNeil and Kip dig into the origins of gravitational wave detection, tracing its roots to Joe Weber's early experiments and Ray Weiss's unpublished paper.  Kip reflects on the decades of work required to make LIGO a success, the challenges of measuring distortions a fraction of a proton‚Äôs width, and the historic detection of gravitational waves in 2016 that confirmed Einstein‚Äôs predictions. \n\nWhy don‚Äôt quantum physics and the theory of relativity mix? We discuss the mysteries of quantum gravity, the paradox of black hole information loss, and Kip‚Äôs legendary bet with Stephen Hawking and John Preskell. Kip explains why backward time travel may be possible, Hawking Radiation, and theories for why information can be lost. As they explore the intersection of science and art, Kip discusses his passion for storytelling and some of his future projects, from his poetry-art collaborations to documenting the history of LIGO.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Introduction: Kip Thorne\n04:47 - Creating the Movie Interstellar\n17:16 - The Giant Wave on Miller‚Äôs Planet\n24:01 - Time Dilation Around Gargantuan\n28:54 - Inside the Black Hole & Higher Dimension Spacetime\n34:05 - Using Wormholes to Travel Backwards in Time\n44:22 - Exotic Matter & Controlling Vacuum Fluctuations\n50:50 - Finding Gravitational Waves with LIGO\n01:07:01 - Winning The Nobel prize\n1:10:04 - Kip‚Äôs Bet on The Black Hole Information Paradox\n1:25:33 - The Problem with Relativity and Quantum Physics\n1:31:03 - Poetry, Documenting LIGO, & The Future\n1:40:08 - Closing Thoughts\n\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

Bluehost doesn‚Äôt influence our editorial decisions, but they make videos like this possible.\n\nWhen choosing a restaurant you probably look at a few things: What type of food do they serve? How close is it? Maybe if they‚Äôre allergen- or kid-friendly. You‚Äôre very likely looking at the list of entrees available to see if anything strikes you before even making a reservation. It‚Äôs a pretty typical way to choose a restaurant. After all, you want to enjoy your night out. But chef-instructor Kathryn Gordon from the Institute of Culinary Education in New York has one more suggestion: ‚ÄúI think you should try to look at the dessert menu more.‚Äù\n\nDesserts at most restaurants have gotten boring. You might find an incredible blend of cocktails or a wide-ranging wine list, followed by a well-curated list of sharable plates for appetizers, and of course the entrees will almost always offer some sort of wow factor. Oftentimes, dessert isn‚Äôt even on the main menu. Even the menu itself can feel like an afterthought ‚Äî and when it hits the table, you‚Äôre likely staring down the same options you‚Äôve seen hundreds of times before. There‚Äôs a reason for this.

Serial killers were also brought to the big screen such as the story of Aileen Wuornos in Monster and Jeffrey Dahmer in Dahmer, both of which stirred controversy.

It‚Äôs one of the few places where matriarchal structures survive. The Juchitec matriarchy is a legacy of the Zapotec civilization.\n\nIn a film from the 1930s, the Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein documented the life of the Zapotecs - self-determined women who worked as traders, kept stores of gold and chose their own husbands. This matriarchy where women wield the economic power and run public life was a legacy of the more than 2,500-year-old Zapotec culture. What‚Äôs left of this a century later, in a nation well-known for its machismo culture?\nZapotec women live in the southern Mexican city of Juchit√°n, in a region that thrives on exchange between North and South, between the Pacific and the Atlantic. Here, the women have always done the trading. Lola took over her mother‚Äôs store selling traditional items of clothing. In 2017, an earthquake hit the region and destroyed the market, the beating heart of the city. The catastrophe also jeopardized the power of Zapotec women. With the support of her two daughters Paulina and Marisela, Lola and the other market traders were able to get back to work. Together they were once again able to organize what‚Äôs always been a motor of their redistribution economy: Festivals.\n600 festivals are celebrated in the city every year, with women as the focal point. In a few days‚Äô time it‚Äôll be Jade‚Äôs 15th birthday marking her entry into this community of women. Her mother Ana Lilia, also a market trader, has been saving up for this event for months and wants everything to be perfect. Her muxe friend Coral helps her with the decorations made from thousands of colored cut-out pieces of paper.\nIn Juchit√°n, muxes identify as people of the third gender. They are born male and assume women‚Äôs roles in the family and within society. Once a year, a church mass is held in honor of the more than 4,000 muxes - a unique event in Mexico. With every day and every festival, the Zapotec women of Juchit√°n defy the prevailing machismo in Mexico and fight to sustain their tradition.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Helicopters such as the Westland Sea King. The most significant British naval helicopter in the last 60 years. What makes the Sea King stand out from other helicopters is its sheer versatility and adaptability. Over almost fifty years of service with the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force from 1969-2018, the Sea King was used in numerous roles, well beyond its original design as an anti-submarine warfare helicopter. It was what is known as a ‚Äòutility helicopter‚Äô ‚Äì an aircraft designed for multiple tasks. It saw service as a ‚Äòcommando‚Äô troop carrier, a heavy lift transport, an anti-ship helicopter, an airborne early warning aircraft, and even a search and rescue helicopter.

Those who know the answer aren‚Äôt willing to talk.\n\nIn pursuing leads as to the whereabouts of the work, this documentary not only explores the excesses of the global art trade, it also sheds light on the emotional connections that people have formed with the portrait.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

How can we write better user stories and avoid these common mistakes? \n\nRequirements vs User Story Requirements, are they the same, are user story requirements a thing? There are really only three steps in building software, having an idea of the problem that we‚Äôd like to solve, building some software to solve it and then checking that the software does what we think and solves the problem. A User Story is focused on the first step, but if we get them right they make the next two steps much easier. \n\nIn this episode Dave Farley explores 5 common user story mistakes that make software engineering and continuous delivery more difficult, rather than easier. During his exploration of the mistakes, Dave describes some of the properties of better, more useful, user stories and the reasons why they are better.\n\nCD TRAINING COURSES\nIf you want to learn Continuous Delivery and DevOps skills, check out Dave Farley's courses\nhttps://bit.ly/DFTraining \n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS & LINKS\nYou can grab Dave Farley's new book 'Continuous Delivery Pipelines' here:\nhttps://leanpub.com/cd-pipelines\nDavid Farley ‚Ä¢ Modern Software Engineering ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3GI468M\nDave Farley & Jez Humble ‚Ä¢ Continuous Delivery ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3ocIHwd\nForsgren, Humble & Kim ‚Ä¢ Accelerate ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/367RI5o\nGojko Adzic & David Evans ‚Ä¢ 50 Quick Ideas to Improve your User Stories ‚Ä¢ https://leanpub.com/50quickideas\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#GOTOxDaveFarley #UserStories #StoryMistakes #Requirements #Programming #DaveFarley #GOTO #GOTOcon #Complexity  #ProgrammingTutorial #SoftwareEngineering\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos & other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

For these, scientists known as analog astronauts practice for the journey to the Red Planet, collecting knowledge along the way. AMADEE-24 is the name of the current mission, which will take place in 2024 in cooperation with the Armenian Space Agency in the Ararat region, an environment with Mars-like geology. \n\nThe film accompanies the mission through its highs and lows. However, the Austrian Space Forum and its many volunteers are not only practicing for the colonization of Mars. Under the direction of Gernot Gr√∂mer, they are also working on a nanosatellite that searches for space debris. Space may be infinite, but the Earth's nearby orbits now resemble a large garbage dump. \n\nEurope must keep a foot in the door, rather than leaving the space race up to China and the USA: That‚Äôs the goal of Augsburg rocket engineer Stefan Brieschenk. He founded the Rocket Factory Augsburg in 2018. He‚Äôs working hard, both here and in the far north of Sweden, on a rocket that will soon launch satellites into space from Europe -- at an unbeatable price. The Rocket Factory recycles items from other industrial sectors, including tanks from the brewing industry. \n\nA film that sheds light on the opportunities and risks inherent to the business of space. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The TT-33 or ‚ÄòTokarev‚Äô Pistol was named after its designer Fedor Tokarev, and was initially conceived as a modern replacement for the aging Nagant M1895 revolver. The simplicity of its design as well as an improvement in firepower would result in the production of over a million of the pistols by the end of the conflic.\n\nSecond is the Mosin-Nagant bolt-action rifle, the standard infantry weapon of the Red Army during World War II. Originally designed in 1891, the rifle would undergo several modifications before its M91/30 variant became standard issue for the Soviets. By the time World War Two had broken out, the rifle's ruggedness, reliability, and mass-production capability made it an indispensable weapon for the nation‚Äôs war effort. It was also used by the famous Soviet snipers of the era, including Vasily Zaitsev and Lyudmila Pavlichenko.\n\nThird up, the PPSh-41 or ‚ÄòPistolet-Pulemyot Shpagina‚Äô named after its designer Georgy Shpagin. This rapid weapon, capable of firing 1000 rounds per minute, was not simply a stunning submachine gun but a stalwart of the Red Army in World War Two. Adopted as a cost-effective alternative to the PPD-40, the PPSh-41 soon became a symbol of Soviet infantry firepower and played a critical role in the close quarters fighting  that has become synonymous with the sieges and battles of the Eastern Front.\n\nLast but not least is the 'DP', otherwise known as ‚ÄòDegtyaryov‚Äô machine gun. Designed for the Soviet Red Army in the 1920s under the leadership of Vasily Degtyaryov and trialled shortly before the Second World War broke out, the gas-operated DP would prove to be a much relied upon support weapon of the Red Army. Produced 800,000 times across four decades and with a service history that extends to the modern day, the DP proved to be an extremely trustworthy and versatile firearm - with many variations developed for multi-purpose use.\n\nDiscover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.

For testing, of course, this creates a challenge. Companies no longer control all the hardware or the data. There are many more assumptions in play. The industry is moving away from expensive kits that rarely break, to virtualised improvised magicked-up systems running on commodity hardware and likely to blow up at any time.

This is because many factories use plastic waste as fuel - including in food production. \nMeanwhile, residents of the soon-to-be former capital Jakarta are facing another environmental problem: due to global warming and the excessive extraction of groundwater, the country's largest city is sinking several centimeters every year - around 40% of the urban area is now below sea level. Environmental experts warn that a third of Jakarta could be permanently flooded by 2050 if subsidence continues at the current rate. While former President Joko Widodo approved the plan to build the new capital Nusantara on the island of Borneo in August 2019, authorities and specialists are building a dike in a bid to protect Jakarta from the rising waters.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

For the past thirty years the space programs of many nations have been sending landed platforms of increasing complexity, revealing the Red Planet‚Äôs ancient past. One of the most challenging aspects of all missions to Mars is the ability to achieve a safe landing on the surface, from an initial entry speed of 30,000 miles per hour to a soft touchdown. During the descent to the surface robots and eventually people must be protected from extreme temperatures and G-forces by complex engineered systems. On the surface they must be able to survive radiation and low pressures, with only the limited resources they can bring with them.\n\nThis talk will discuss the motivation for Mars exploration and how engineering challenges are tackled with computational modeling, cutting-edge technologies, and out-of-the-box thinking. Engineering the Red Planet is the key to our future and understanding our past.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nNASA ‚Ä¢ NASA Systems Engineering Handbook ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3FWjqhR\nBernice Kastner ‚Ä¢ Space Mathematics ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3oQCDKF\nKellie Gerardi ‚Ä¢ Not Necessarily Rocket Science ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3CW4HS9\nPiers Bizony & Roger D.

It is a whole-team approach to doing all the work the team does including designing, coding, testing, and working with the customers, users and other stakeholders. This is an evolutionary step beyond pair programming and accentuates face-to-face communication, team alignment, collaboration, and self-organizing team concepts of the Agile approach to software development.\n\nMob Programming can be a highly effective approach to software development. There are numerous teams doing Mob Programming all over the world, including distributed teams, and there have been a number of positive reports of success. Please join me as I share how the concept got started, the benefits, techniques we use, and some of the problems we've faced.\n\nStructure This presentation provides a description of Mob Programming, how is came to be, the benefits we've seen, and some tips on how to do it yourself.

Become a Vox Member today: http://www.vox.com/memberships\n\nOne thing is clear: The roughly 75 million people who voted for Trump were saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to lots of things.\n\nBut what were they saying ‚Äúyes‚Äù to?\n\nIn this excerpt from The Gray Area podcast, Sean Illing and Vox senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp try to figure out whether Trumpism is a movement or just a moment. Is it a political ideology that we‚Äôll reckon with for years to come, or just a collection of whims from the most powerful man in the world? And what does it mean for the country‚Äôs political future?\n\nBeauchamp is the author of The Reactionary Spirit: How America's Most Insidious Political Tradition Swept the World. It‚Äôs a book about democracy and the contradictions and conflicts at the heart of it. https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/zack-beauchamp/the-reactionary-spirit/9781541704411/?lens=publicaffairs \n\nListen to the full conversation.

His message: Stop eating meat, cook with soy!\n\nIn his church in the megacity of Barquisimeto in northern Venezuela, a Catholic priest gives cooking classes. He wants to show how soy can replace meat in almost every dish. But he is not motivated by veganism or a change in diet due to climate change. Jose Maria simply wants to ensure that the children in the slums are well fed. Dried soy is rich in protein and can help prevent malnutrition. It's inexpensive, which is crucial in a country hit hard by inflation.
