They almost always have masses many millions of times that of the sun, while the biggest grow to tens of billions. Exactly what was responsible for seeding these great engines, and building up their immense sizes, is a challenge only the James Webb Telescope can rise to. \n\nThe concept of “Engine Black Holes” came from a book I read as an 12 year old, which talked about the Direct Collapse model. I don’t know what book it was or what happened to it, but I intended to bring it to life in this video. Merry Christmas! And many happy returns in 2024. \n\nJoin my Discord Server: https://discord.com/invite/sea\nMerchandise: https://the-sea-store.creator-spring.com\n\nYou can now support the channel on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/sea_media\nPatrons get ad-free access to videos, and also get early access sneak peaks!\n\nDo you use these videos to sleep or for night time watching?

She presented a tiny piece of 1,300-year-old papyrus with an inscription: \"Jesus said to them: my wife...I dwell with her.”\n\nDespite its authenticity, the parchment was not recognized by religious authorities. However, two years later, in 2014, a new text was discovered in the British Library in London. It was a bombshell. This text tells of a marital relationship between Jesus and his 'wife,' Mary Magdalene. Could these revelations indicate that the couple had children? \n  \nThis documentary uses animation to bring clues to life, while taking a new scientific look at the question of whether or not Jesus might have had children. The film examines apocryphal relics -- from recently discovered tombs to ancient parchments. It analyzes inscriptions and the results of scientific tests. The aim is to shed light on one of the oldest mysteries in the world.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act was a reaction to the Enron and WorldCom scandals. Dodd-Frank was enacted in 2010 after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nGood regulation can bring all sorts of benefits, but excessive regulation, does little to serve the public interest, and creates financial costs and frustration for businesses and the public. \n\nElon Musk has vowed to dismantle thousands of federal regulations as the co-head of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, saying the nation’s financial security depends on it.

Many teams who become more confident in progress, or getting work done, often embrace the more ambiguous question of product, or “Are we meeting the needs of our customers”, with some customers buying, by paying for subscriptions, and others buying in, by showing (and glowing about) their use of the system.\n\nIn this session, I’ll share experiences helping companies adopt a customer and product / services approach. From small digital product companies to large enterprises who are IT focused, I will present an approach for moving to or augmenting an existing move towards impact driven work.\n\nTopics that will be covered include:\n• mapping teams to #products and services\n• early #ProductDiscovery\n• blending product discovery and #ProductDelivery\n• and if there is enough time, ideas for doing these things at scale.\n\nIf we run out of time, there is always the hallways, where some of the best conversations take place.

MyPay™ from Chime can help. MyPay lets you get up to $500* of your pay before payday, giving you the freedom to jump on last-minute deals, handle unexpected expenses, and gain more control over your finances, without waiting on someone else’s schedule.

Now, residents are joining forces to resist the digital giants and real estate sharks threatening to drive the poorest out of the area.\n\nJournalist Fabien Benoît met the residents of East Palo Alto; people who have formed an alliance against Google, Amazon & Co. to stop rent hikes and evictions and protect their multicultural neighborhood from gentrification.\n\nLaura works as a cleaner. Antonio studies at Stanford and comes from a low-income family background. He’s been elected to the local council, where he gives a voice to his neighborhood and his community. Ofelia is one of a group of young residents. During the coronavirus pandemic, the three activists started to push back against what they describe as \"capitalist colonization.” They continue to campaign for those who’ve missed out on the economic miracle of the tech industry that’s sprouted up around them.\n\nWith their activism and creative methods of resistance, the residents of East Palo Alto inspire others to think about the world of tomorrow. They also show that it’s possible to stand up to the Internet giants.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

They need to find a place with cooperative weather, a few landscapes to choose from, a big enough workforce, and — perhaps most importantly — one that fits their budget. \n\nAll these factors mean that locations with downtowns, country landscapes, mountain ranges, and water features within a drivable distance are highly sought after, especially when they also have good tax credits. While Hollywood might be the legendary film capital of the world, places like Vancouver are becoming more and more popular thanks to the the flexible landscapes and tax breaks. \n\nVox is on a mission is to help everyone, regardless of income or status, understand our complicated world so that we can all help shape it.

Cyberbullies engage in a series of campaigns intended to provoke an intense emotional reaction from the victim. The film explores some of their most perfidious methods.\n\nTens of thousands of people have an Internet-based hobby. A cruel game that plays on online anonymity and looks something like this: Cyberbullies home in on victims through social media channels and begin goading them into online emotional outbursts. And clock up each one of these outbursts as a triumph.\n\nThe group profiled in the film has a hierarchical structure and calls itself the NWO, an abbreviation for \"New World Order” or also \"Nie Wieder Online”, or \"Never Again Online”. Members meet on the communication platform Discord, allocate their tasks and brag about their activities online. Some hack accounts to access personal data, others order pizzas or packages en masse in the name of the victims.\n\n*[Warning: This documentary addresses the topic of suicide. If you or someone you know is suffering from serious emotional strain or suicidal thoughts, do not hesitate to seek professional help.

That George Washington owned enslaved people who were Muslim? And that a Muslim diplomat broke his Ramadan fast in the White House in 1805? These are some of the facts that Aymann Ismail (staff writer, Slate Magazine) discovers as he explores the role that Muslims played in the imagination of America’s founding generation. Aymann’s journey takes him from George Washington’s Mount Vernon to Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello but begins in the Library of Congress. Here he sees two books that symbolize the promise and contradictions of the early Republic; Jefferson’s copy of the Qur’an and an autobiography written by an enslaved African Muslim, Omar Ibn Said, who was brought to the United States during Jefferson’s presidency.  Through these books, Ayman discovers how some Muslims were included in the founders’ vision of religious freedom in the nascent Republic, while other Muslims were denied all their rights, because of their race and legal status. \n\nThe film features interviews with Keith Ellison (the first Muslim elected to Congress,) Denise A. Spellberg (author of Thomas Jefferson’s Qur’an: Islam and the Founders), and Jeffrey Einboden (author of Jefferson’s Muslim Fugitives: The Lost Story of Enslaved Africans, their Arabic Letters, and an American President). \n\nMade possible by viewers like you.

The series is hosted by three leading American Muslim journalists: Malika Bilal, Aymann Ismail, and Asma Khalid. Over the course of the series, they travel the country to piece together stories spanning over 200 years. from the first Muslims to arrive as enslaved people from Africa to the establishment of early South Asian, Syrian-Lebanese, and Black American Muslim communities. The series weaves key moments in U.S. history with the unexpected but essential story threads of Muslims whose lived experiences offer us new insight into how race, religion, and nationality are intertwined in the American fabric.

Their growing debt burden has far outpaced that of older generations, and it’s only getting worse. Generation Z is being hit the hardest, thanks to lower income and the rising cost of everything from food to housing.

Learn more about Vancouver at findyourrefresh.com. Our sponsor has no editorial influence over how we report our stories, but their support makes videos like these possible.\n\nMovie magic is what makes our favorite films so good: Actors flawlessly inhabiting the personalities of totally made-up characters, visual effects transforming a green screen to an otherworldly setting, musical scores making us feel every emotion under the sun. But there’s another kind of magic we don’t talk about as much: one physical location masquerading as another. And it happens all the time.\n\nWhen filmmakers are trying to make a movie, deciding where to shoot isn’t as straightforward as choosing the location described in the script. They need to find a place with cooperative weather, a few landscapes to choose from, a big enough workforce, and — perhaps most importantly — one that fits their budget. \n\nAll these factors mean that locations with downtowns, country landscapes, mountain ranges, and water features within a drivable distance are highly sought after, especially when they also have good tax credits. While Hollywood might be the legendary film capital of the world, places like Vancouver are becoming more and more popular thanks to the flexible landscapes and tax breaks. \n\nThis is especially true for holiday movies — many of which are filmed in Canada. In this video, we talk to a prolific Christmas movie producer — who has worked on films like 2024’s Netflix hit Hot Frosty — about shooting movies in Canada. \n\nCorrection: In a previous version of this video we mistakenly said that Clark Kent's farm in the TV show Smallville was in Kentucky at :58 and 1:13. The Kent family farm was actually in Kansas. We've corrected the error.  \n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (🔔) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nSupport our work.

Relatives from their home countries, such as Iraq, Syria and Egypt, are looking for them. Polish volunteers offer their support in what is often a distressing endeavor.\n\nThe migration route through Belarus to Poland is an established one, despite the presence of a border fence, heavily armed guards and reports of increasing brutality in what is effectively an exclusion zone. Although it may be considered safer than trying to cross the Mediterranean or the Atlantic, people following this route to Europe are also dying with increasing regularity.  \n\nThey perish in the forests and swamps between Poland and Belarus, thousands of kilometers away from their home countries and desperate families who often have no idea what’s happened to their loved ones. But one group of people living in the Podlaskie border region is concerned with the fate of the dead and missing. They try to help the relatives to identify their family members. The film follows the story of Mohammed Sabah’s family, as they try to find what’s happened to him.\n\nMohammed left his home in Erbil, the capital of the autonomous region of Kurdistan in Iraq, in the fall of 2021. In November 2021, he got held up in the neutral zone between Poland and Belarus and after a few weeks, was pushed back to Belarus by Polish border guards. Mohammed contacted his family for the last time at the beginning of December. He kept in touch through his uncle Rekaut, who’s lived in London for 15 years. There was no sign of life from Mohammed until October 2022, when a video emerged, allegedly showing Mohammed crossing the border fence into Poland.  \n\nAll hope now lies with Mohammed's uncle Rekaut, who maintains contact with the authorities and NGOs on behalf of the family and goes to Poland whenever he can. In Erbil, Mohammed's family desperately hopes he’s still alive - but at the very least, they just want to know his fate.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #migration \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Coming in the wake of a state investigation that found a broad cascade of failures, “Maui’s Deadly Firestorm” investigates critical missteps that day — and in the years prior, as the county and state were repeatedly advised to invest more money in prevention and preparedness, and as experts and residents raised concerns.\n\nThe documentary draws on harrowing footage filmed by those in the path of the inferno and firsthand accounts from survivors, victims’ families and friends, first responders, and local and state authorities. Through these accounts as well as a detailed analysis of over a thousand 911 calls and public records across multiple government agencies, it provides a wrenching, moment-by-moment reconstruction of the fire and its aftermath. \n\nThe film also examines how changes to the climate and landscape have made Maui increasingly vulnerable to fires and raises difficult questions about what led to the fire’s heavy toll.\n\n“Maui’s Deadly Firestorm” is a FRONTLINE production with Mandarin Duck Films LLC. The writer, producer and director is Xinyan Yu. The producer is Christina Avalos. The senior producer is Frank Koughan.

By emphasizing the creation of tailored, flexible tools, Girba presents a way to reduce the friction of working with complex systems and legacy code. He explores how contextualized tools, such as those provided by the Glamorous Toolkit, allow developers to engage with software environments in a more intuitive and efficient manner.\n\nThe integration of generative AI is also examined, where Girba argues that AI's true potential lies not in providing definitive answers but in assisting developers by generating hypotheses and creating tools that support deeper engagement with code. Additionally, the concept of \"habitability\" is introduced, proposing that software systems, like physical spaces, should be navigable and comprehensible to developers, fostering a more productive and enjoyable experience.\n\nThis vision of a future where software systems are more accessible and adaptable reflects the growing need to rethink how we interact with code, empowering developers with the tools and perspectives necessary to navigate increasingly complex digital landscapes.

It has been woven into all aspects of modern software by being presented as a utopian vision: a way of making human lives easier, doing repetitive tasks faster and with fewer errors, freeing us fallible humans up to do other ostensibly more important work. But anyone who has worked directly with automated systems knows that we are still very far from such a dreamy reality.\n\nThis talk delves into detailed research about how automation is involved in software incidents. My focus on this area stems from the growing portrayal of automation as a panacea for various software incident issues, despite its limitations in effectively addressing these challenges, such as reliable detection and resolution of software issues or analyzing and disseminating learnings from these incidents back into the organization and its products and services.\n\nDrawn directly from public incident reports (collected in the VOID), this research revealed multiple, often competing, roles that automation can play over the course of an incident, and most importantly underscored how important humans are at understanding, troubleshooting, and recovering from automated software issues. If you're struggling to convey the reality behind the hype of automation and AI to others on your team or at your organization, this is the talk for you.

The Syrian regime's army besieged the neighbourhood in 2011 and bombarded it mercilessly during the civil war. It was a rathole for the helpless population, including women and children. In 2012 a group of reporters sneaked into the besieged Baba Amr through tunnels to expose the massacre to the world. The film shows important testimonies of this crime against humanity, including the voices of journalists, survivors and perpetrators. It also explores international legal attempts prior to the fall of the Assad regime to combat impunity for these terrible crimes, and the need for recognition and justice for the victims and survivors. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #syria #assad \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

However, implementations have veered between two extremes: incredible abstractive power with a steep learning curve; and limited domain-specific uses that can be picked up in minutes. Why can't we have our cake and eat it too?\n\n#Goggles is a new #Scala macro built over the powerful & popular Monocle optics library. It uses Scala's macros and scandalously flexible syntax to create a compiler-checked mini-language to concisely construct, compose and apply optics, with a gentle, familiar interface, and extravagantly informative compiler errors.\n\nIn this talk I'll introduce the motivation for lenses and why usability is a problem that so badly needs solving, and how the #GogglesLibrary, with #Monocle, helps address this in an important way. There'll be some juicy discussion of Scala macro sorcery too!\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nSimon Brown • Software Architecture for Developers Vol. 2 • https://leanpub.com/visualising-software-architecture\nDavid Farley • Modern Software Engineering • https://amzn.to/3GI468M\nDave Farley & Jez Humble • Continuous Delivery • https://amzn.to/3ocIHwd\nWoods, Erder & Pureur • Continuous Architecture in Practice • https://amzn.to/2QWAmkl\nGeorge Fairbanks • Just Enough Software Architecture • https://amzn.to/3uZzVo0\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#SoftwareEngineering #Programming #KenScambler #SoftwareDevelopment #YOWcon\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos & other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

The film explores new ways to provide more appropriate care to sufferers of this disease.\n\nDementia is a disease that not only torments those affected, but also often puts relationships with loved ones under severe strain. 1.8 million people in Germany suffer from dementia. It’s estimated that by 2050, that figure could rise to more than 2.8 million. The question of appropriate and, above all, humane care is becoming increasingly urgent. Most dementia sufferers are accommodated in care homes. However, this is often not the best concept, due to a shortage of skilled nursing staff and other factors. What is needed are places where people can feel safe and secure.\n\nIn this report, we meet people with first-hand experience of dementia - like Julia Bernsee, whose mother was diagnosed with the disease in 2019. Her mother was able to stay at home initially, but then Julia took her into her own home. When her mother spent some time in a nursing home, Julia was alarmed at the realities of care in such places. This is because dementia patients are often sedated with medication. But then Julia found a new facility.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #dementia \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

A civilization's plumbing can teach us about the diets they ate, the diseases they contracted, how they conducted civil engineering projects, and possibly even what their attitudes about bathrooms were. \n\nBut our information about ancient bathrooms and toilets is still fairly new, especially when it comes to ancient Rome. Until recently, the bathroom habits of the ancients weren't considered an appropriate subject for academic study. When previous archaeologists did unearth ancient toilets, they came up with fantastical alternate reasons for their uses to avoid describing how they were actually used. When Italian excavator Giacomo Boni discovered a Roman toilet in 1913, he imagined that it was a water pump that powered the entire house. \n\nTo  read more about Roman toilets and plumbing, go here:\nhttps://www.ranker.com/list/ancient-roman-toilets-history/jim-rowley\n\nBe sure to subscribe to the Weird History Newsletter: https://www.ranker.com/newsletters/weird-history?utm_source=Youtube&utm_medium=WeirdHistory&utm_campaign=WHnewsletters&utm_content=description_box\n\n#ancientrome #plumbing #weirdhistory","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/9HaCRGeolMc?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"How the Bitcoin Protocol Actually Works • Jan Møller • YOW! 2016","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Xsut4MQYhg","date":1734267614,"author":"GOTO Conferences","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"This presentation was recorded at YOW! 2016. #GOTOcon #YOW\nhttps://yowcon.com\n\nJan Møller - Co-Founder & CTO at Chainalysis\n\nRESOURCES\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-møller-bb32141\nhttps://x.com/jan_moller\n\nABSTRACT\nA solution to a problem that by many scientists was believed impossible to solve was proposed in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto.

In the very first days of the war, Russian troops occupied the exclusion zone around what’s left of Chernobyl. Shortly afterwards, they took control of Zaporizhzhia’s nuclear power plant.\n\nRussian troops withdrew from Chernobyl after a few weeks. But Zaporizhzhia, Europe's largest nuclear power plant, has effectively been occupied since March 2022. The plant has come under frequent attack, the power supply has been interrupted and fires have broken out. Experts have repeatedly warned of a possible nuclear disaster. How safe are nuclear power plants in a time of war? And how is the Russian occupation affecting the nuclear plant’s Ukrainian employees? What can the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) do? \n\nThe documentary follows three employees of Ukrainian nuclear power plants and describes the consequences of the Russian occupation. These include fear, illegal interrogations and torture. For IAEA chief Rafael Grossi, staff working conditions are the biggest cause for concern. \n\nDirector Pavlo Cherepin’s involvement in the film brought back personal memories. He learned the word evacuation early in his childhood, following the Chernobyl reactor accident. One of the worst nuclear disasters in history, Chernobyl has not been forgotten here in Ukraine -- a country that renounced nuclear weapons in 1994 in return for security guarantees.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #russiaukrainewar #russia #ukraine \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
