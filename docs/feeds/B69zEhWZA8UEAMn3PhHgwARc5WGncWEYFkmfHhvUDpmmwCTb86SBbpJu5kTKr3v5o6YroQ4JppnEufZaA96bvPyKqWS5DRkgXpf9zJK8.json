They added that the Syrian army has been joined by Russian and Iranian officers, as both countries have been longtime allies of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nState news agency SANA confirmed that the government was waging \"fierce battles\" across Hama province, led by \"joint Syrian-Russian warplanes.\"\n\nGerman news agency DPA said that award-winning Syrian photographer Anas Alkharboutli was killed in one of the airstrikes on Hama.\n\n#Syria #Assad #Hama\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1",

It was the first time a French government had been voted down by parliament in more than 60 years. That ramps up the pressure on President Emmanuel Macron, who is struggling to pass much-needed reforms aimed at addressing mounting economic concerns. Meanwhile Macron has given a defiant television address,  saying he would appoint a new premier in the coming days - but he gave no hints as to who it might be. He blamed his opponents on the far right AND the far left for the defeat - accusing them of choosing disorder rather than working together to pass a budget. Macron also said he had no intention of leaving office before his term ends in 2027. \n\nWith analysis from DW's Paris Correspondent Lisa Louis and Journalist Daniel Brown.\n\n#macron #france #michelbarnier \n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1",
