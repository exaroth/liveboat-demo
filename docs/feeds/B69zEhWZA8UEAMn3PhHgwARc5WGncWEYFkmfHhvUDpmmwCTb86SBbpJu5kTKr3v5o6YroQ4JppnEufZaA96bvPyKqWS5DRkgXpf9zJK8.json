Many in Taipei point to how Beijing has imposed a harsh national security law in Hong Kong—despite pledges of allowing the former British colony to maintain autonomy under the model of “one country, two systems.” Many also remember how Taiwanese identity was repressed under Nationalist-rule on the island. Democracy and civil rights are now central to Taiwanese identity. But for Beijing promoting “separatism” is a crime.  Even speeches from Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te have led to massive Chinese displays of military force.  Taiwan’s main political parties have different strategies on how to avoid conflict and being pressured by Beijing. The KMT say provoking China could lead to war and the governing DPP argue Taiwan must deter China.
