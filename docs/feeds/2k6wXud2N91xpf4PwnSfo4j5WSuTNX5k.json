At the same time, though, it has been difficult to check devices for infection, leading individuals to navigate an ad hoc array of academic institutions and NGOs that have been on the front lines of developing forensic techniques to detect mobile spyware. On Tuesday, the mobile device security firm iVerify is <a href=\"http://iverify.io/blog/iverify-mobile-threat-investigation-uncovers-new-pegasus-samples\">publishing findings</a> from a spyware detection feature it launched in May. Of 2,500 device scans that the company's customers elected to submit for inspection, seven revealed infections by the notorious NSO Group malware known as Pegasus.</p>\n<p>The company’s Mobile Threat Hunting feature uses a combination of malware signature-based detection, heuristics, and machine learning to look for anomalies in iOS and Android device activity or telltale signs of spyware infection. For paying iVerify customers, the tool regularly checks devices for potential compromise. But the company also offers a free version of the feature for anyone who downloads the iVerify Basics app for $1. These users can walk through steps to generate and send a special diagnostic utility file to iVerify and receive analysis within hours. Free users can use the tool once a month. iVerify's infrastructure is built to be privacy-preserving, but to run the Mobile Threat Hunting feature, users must enter an email address so the company has a way to contact them if a scan turns up spyware—as it did in the seven recent Pegasus discoveries.</p>\n<p>“The really fascinating thing is that the people who were targeted were not just journalists and activists, but business leaders, people running commercial enterprises, people in government positions,” says Rocky Cole, chief operating officer of iVerify and a former US National Security Agency analyst. “It looks a lot more like the targeting profile of your average piece of malware or your average APT group than it does the narrative that’s been out there that mercenary spyware is being abused to target activists. It is doing that, absolutely, but this cross section of society was surprising to find.”</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/12/1-phone-scanner-finds-seven-pegasus-spyware-infections/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/12/1-phone-scanner-finds-seven-pegasus-spyware-infections/#comments\">Comments</a></p>\n\n            ",

Even 42 years later, Rob Bottin's practical effects are still incredible, capturing each freakish amalgamation of tentacles, sharp teeth, sinew, and traces of malformed humanity with ghastly clarity. I've seen The Thing dozens of times, yet seeing Norris' decapitated head contort and grow arthropod-esque legs will never fail to twist my stomach in knots. These are the everlasting images of The Thing, but it's the alien's ability to perfectly imitate anyone that genuinely terrifies, permeating each scene with an unnerving sense of dread and paranoia that affects both its characters and the audience watching. Who do you trust when anyone could be a clandestine threat?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Back in 2002, developer Computer Artworks attempted to translate this feeling into an officially licensed video game for The Thing. The now-shuttered studio came close to succeeding, too, creating a third-person horror-action game with a unique squad system that ensured you could never entirely trust the person fighting by your side. It's become somewhat of a cult classic since then, leading to this remaster from Nightdive Studios--a developer known for faithfully restoring myriad games, including Shadow Man and Star Wars: Dark Forces. The Thing: Remastered is a similarly authentic experience, albeit with a number of key improvements to the game's visuals, controls, and some quality-of-life mechanics. Beyond this, it's much the same game as it was in 2002, for both the good and the bad.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4410531-thethingremastered-augustscreenshot%282%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4410531\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4410531-thethingremastered-augustscreenshot%282%29.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4410531-thethingremastered-augustscreenshot%282%29.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4410531-thethingremastered-augustscreenshot%282%29.jpg 3840w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4410531-thethingremastered-augustscreenshot%282%29.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/43/434805/4410531-thethingremastered-augustscreenshot%282%29.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">The game's setup is one of its better aspects, acting as a direct sequel to John Carpenter's iconic 1982 film. You play as the bland, one-dimensional Captain Blake, leader of a U.S. Special Forces rescue team sent to investigate Outpost 31 in the isolating tundra of Antarctica. Of course, we know what transpired when MacReady and the rest of this research facility encountered the shape-shifting alien life-form, and it doesn't take long before Blake is fighting off all manner of horrific entities. He's rather nonchalant about the whole thing, though, anchoring a relatively thin story that feels distinctly 2002 in all the worst ways. While it begins as a more action-oriented facsimile of the film it's ostensibly a sequel to, the narrative quickly delves into predictable territory with the military experimenting on the Thing to use the alien for its own gain. It's all very stereotypical, with melodramatic voice acting and--aside from a fun cameo from John Carpenter himself--an inherently disposable cast of characters.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-thing-remastered-review-cold-fear/1900-6418323/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",

      "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">The second level in Indiana Jones and The Great Circle takes Indy inside the bowels of Vatican City. It's the first time when MachineGames breaks loose from its linear shackles, presenting you with a massive play area to freely explore. I went from gawking at Michelangelo's masterpiece on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel to exploring the ancient ruins hidden deep beneath the holy city, spending more than three hours on this single level alone without coming close to completing every task in Indy's journal.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It's not quite what I expected from a studio known for its frenetic shooters, nor a game that's been described as a first-person action-adventure. For the most part, The Great Circle is a stealth game that resembles Dishonored more than any of MachineGames' previous output. Sure, you could skulk through the shadows in Wolfenstein, plunging knives into Nazi spines, but it was a shooter first and foremost. The Great Circle has moments of action, but its violence is sudden and tends to end quickly, indicative of Indiana Jones as a character; it wouldn't make sense if he were running and gunning like BJ Blazkowicz. It's a refreshing change of pace for the studio, and it's a rip-roaring good time, even if the inexperience of creating this sort of game sometimes shows.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In terms of story and tone, MachineGames definitely understood the assignment. The Great Circle's prologue is essentially a love letter to Raiders of the Lost Ark, immediately making it clear how much the studio both grasps and reveres the series and its globe-trotting protagonist. This feeling persists throughout the entire game, beginning with an opening level that takes place inside the fictional walls of Marshall College, where Indy teaches archeology. The Great Circle is set between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, weaving into the existing fabric of the series in a way that makes it feel like a natural extension of Indy's story. A few familiar faces return, and new characters seamlessly blend into its cinematic world, contributing to a compelling adventure that sees you travel the world, uncover ancient mysteries, and butt heads with the Axis powers.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",

Smarter, faster, and more features (e.g. multimodality) than o1-preview. Live in ChatGPT now, coming to API soon.\" \n\n- \"ChatGPT Pro. $200/month. Unlimited usage and even-smarter mode for using o1. More benefits to come!\" \n\nAltman added this update later:\nFor extra clarity: o1 is available in our plus tier, for $20/month. With the new pro tier ($200/month), it can think even harder for the hardest problems. Most users will be very happy with o1 in the plus tier! \n VentureBeat points out that subscribers \"also gain access to GPT-4o, known for its advanced natural language generation capabilities, and the Advanced Voice feature for speech-based interactions.\" \n\nAnd even for non-subscribers, ChatGPT can now also analyze images, points out VentureBeat, \"a hugely helpful feature upgrade as it enables users to upload photos and have the AI chatbot respond to them, giving them detailed plans on how to build a birdhouse entirely from a single candid photo of one, for one fun example.\"\n\nIn another, potentially more serious and impressive example, it is now capable of helping design data centers from sketches... o1 represents a significant evolution in reasoning model capabilities, including better handling of complex tasks, image-based reasoning, and enhanced accuracy. Enterprise and Education users will gain access to the model next week... OpenAI's updates also include safety enhancements, with the o1-preview scoring 84 on a rigorous safety test, compared to 22 for its predecessor... \n\nTo encourage the use of AI in societal-benefit fields, OpenAI has announced the ChatGPT Pro Grant Program. The initiative will initially award 10 grants to leading medical researchers, providing free access to ChatGPT Pro tools.\n \nIn a video Altman displays graphs showing o1 dramatically outperforms gpt4o on math questions, on competition coding at CodeForces, and on PhD-level science questions.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=OpenAI+Releases+'Smarter%2C+Faster'+ChatGPT+-+Plus+%24200-a-Month+Subscriptions+for+'Even-Smarter+Mode'%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F06%2F0121217%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F06%2F0121217%2Fopenai-releases-smarter-faster-chatgpt---plus-200-a-month-subscriptions-for-even-smarter-mode%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://slashdot.org/story/24/12/06/0121217/openai-releases-smarter-faster-chatgpt---plus-200-a-month-subscriptions-for-even-smarter-mode?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23543071&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

      "content": "\"Okay, we're doing this,\" begins a new announcement at The Verge:\n\nToday we're launching a Verge subscription that lets you get rid of a bunch of ads, gets you unlimited access to our top-notch reporting and analysis across the site and our killer premium newsletters, and generally lets you support independent tech journalism in a world of sponsored influencer content. It'll cost $7 / month or $50 / year &mdash; and for a limited time, if you sign up for the annual plan, we'll send you an absolutely stunning print edition of our CONTENT GOBLINS series, with very fun new photography and design... A surprising number of you have asked us to launch something like this, and we're happy to deliver. If you don't want to pay, rest assured that big chunks of The Verge will remain free &mdash; we're thinking about subscriptions a lot differently than everyone else... \n\nIf you're a Verge reader, you know we've been covering massive, fundamental changes to how the internet works for years now. Most major social media platforms are openly hostile to links, huge changes to search have led to the death of small websites, and everything is covered in a layer of AI slop and weird scams. The algorithmic media ecosystem is now openly hostile to the kind of rigorous, independent journalism we want to do. \n\nA few years ago, we decided the only real way to survive all this was to stand apart and bet on our own website so that we could remain independent of these platforms and their algorithms. We didn't want to write stories to chase Google Search trends or because we thought they'd do well on social media. And we definitely didn't want to compromise our famously strict ethics policy to accept brand endorsement deals from the companies we cover, which almost all of our competitors in the creator economy are forced to do in order to run sustainable businesses... \n\n[W]e intend to keep making this thing together for a long, long time. So many of you like The Verge that we've actually gotten a shocking number of notes from people asking how they can pay to support our work. It's no secret that lots of great websites and publications have gone under over the past few years as the open web falls apart, and it's clear that directly supporting the creators you love is a big part of how everyone gets to stay working on the modern internet. At the same time, we didn't want to simply paywall the entire site &mdash; it's a tragedy that traditional journalism is retreating behind paywalls while nonsense spreads across platforms for free. \n\nThe print premium for subscribers is described as a \"beautiful / deranged print product\" that's drawn from a series of articles \"about what Google had done to the web, capped off by a feature about search engine optimization titled 'The People Who Ruined the Internet.'\"\nBut it ships with a satirical cover that instead proclaims it as \"The Verge Guide to Search Engine Optimization\". A tongue-in-check announcement explains:\n\n[A] year has passed, and we've had a change of heart. Maybe search engine optimization is actually a good thing. Maybe appeasing the search algorithm is not only a sustainable strategy for building a loyal audience, but also a strategic way to plan and produce content. What are journalists, if not content creators? Anyway, SEO community, consider this our apology. And what better way to say \"our bad, your industry is not a cesspool of AI slop but a brilliant vision of what a useful internet could look like\" than collecting all the things we've learned in one handy print magazine? Which is why I'm proud to introduce The Verge Guide to Search Engine Optimization: All the Tips, Tricks, Hints, Schemes, and Techniques for Promoting High-Quality Content! \t \nWhoops &mdash; slip off the cover and the real title appears: \"CONTENT GOBLINS\" (written in green slime). Again, it's \"an anthology of stories about 'content' and the people who 'make' it.\"\n\nIn very Verge fashion, we are meeting the moment where the internet has been overrun by AI garbage by publishing a beautifully designed, limited edition print product. (Also, the last time we printed a magazine, it won a very prestigious design award.) Content Goblins collects some of our best stories over the past couple years, capturing the cynical push for the world's great art and journalism to be reduced into units that can be packaged, distributed, and consumed on the internet. Consider Content Goblins as our resistance to that movement. With terrific new art and photography, we're making the case that great reporting is vital and enduring &mdash; and worth paying for. \n\nThis gorgeous, grotesque magazine can be yours if you commit to an annual subscription to The Verge &mdash; while supplies last.\n<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=The+Verge+Explains+Why%2C+After+13+Years%2C+It's+Offering+a+'Subscription'+Option+for+Its+Supporters%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F04%2F1959245%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F04%2F1959245%2Fthe-verge-explains-why-after-13-years-its-offering-a-subscription-option-for-its-supporters%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/04/1959245/the-verge-explains-why-after-13-years-its-offering-a-subscription-option-for-its-supporters?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23541687&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

      "content": "The use of lead in gasoline \"might have harmed the mental health of a generation,\" reports USA Today.\n\n\nGen X bears an extra burden of conditions such as depression, anxiety, ADHD and neurotic behavior because of the leaded gasoline they were exposed to as children, according to a study published Wednesday in the peer-reviewed Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry. Leaded gas was banned in the United States in 1996, but the study said years of exposure during development made them particularly vulnerable. \n\nLead gas peaked from the mid-1960s through the mid-1970s, and children born during that era would later develop some of the highest rates of mental health symptoms, the study said. The study also linked leaded gas to \"disadvantageous\" traits, such as struggling to concentrate, stay on task or organizing thoughts. \"I tend to think of Generation X as 'generation lead,'\" said Aaron Reuben, a study co-author and assistant professor of clinical neuropsychology at the University of Virginia. \"We know they were exposed to it more and we're estimating they have gone on to have higher rates of internalizing conditions like anxiety, depression and symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder....\" \n\nResearchers linked the lead exposure to an estimated 151 million \"excess mental disorders\" in the United States over the 75-year period. The estimates should be \"considered a floor\" because it relies mainly on gas and not exposure from lead in paint and pipes, Reuben said... Those born between 1966 and 1986 generally had higher mental illness levels linked to lead exposure with the rates peaking for those born between 1966 and 1970, the study said. Those rates coincided with the peak use of lead in gas from the mid-1960s through the mid-1970s... The study said the peak lead use coincided with increased demand for psychiatric care and higher rates of juvenile delinquency.\n \n Today there's routine blood screenings for high levels of lead, study co-author Reuben says. But in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, \"folks were walking around with an average blood lead value that today would trigger clinical follow-up.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=75+Years+of+Lead+in+Gasoline+Caused+150+Million+Mental+Health+Disorders%2C+Study+Finds%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F2356209%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F2356209%2F75-years-of-lead-in-gasoline-caused-150-million-mental-health-disorders-study-finds%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/05/2356209/75-years-of-lead-in-gasoline-caused-150-million-mental-health-disorders-study-finds?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23543021&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

It's all great fun.\"\n\n[E]very single person who drives the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N, whether they're a die-hard EV person or the most hardcore electro-skeptic, absolutely loves it. And they love the fake shifting most of all... Shut up and embrace the fake EV shifting, you nerds. Find some joy in your life for once. \n\nAnd joy will definitely be on order with the new 2025 Kia EV6 GT. The U.S.-spec version of Kia's updated crossover made its debut [November 21] at the L.A. Auto Show. And while there's still a lot we don't know about it, we have power specs and one key detail: the EV6 GT now gets a simulated gear shift feature. \"The GT's new Virtual Gear Shift feature enhances driving immersion by simulating gear shifts with visuals, engine sound effects, and a tactile sensation through motor torque adjustments,\" Kia officials said in a news release. \n\n\nThe Verge points out that Hyundai's Ioniq 5 N even uses speakers &mdash; both inside the car and outside &mdash; to broadcast the sounds of ignition, a boosted EV sound, and a third sound which \"sounds like a robotic version of a fighter jet.\"\nPaired with the seemingly endless power and torque offered by the electric motors, I couldn't stop grinning. It's just like a little kid making car noises as they push a Hot Wheels car around a track, but combined with the driving experience in the Ioniq 5 N, it just taps into a pure enthusiast joy. Even kids around my neighborhood stopped and looked when I started the Ioniq 5 N up with the sound management turned on. They'd pull out their phones to take photos and videos as I drove off, happily faking the internal combustion engine experience and knowing I wasn't adding a drop of carbon to the atmosphere. \n\nThe Ioniq 5 N just might be the performance EV that will change self-described \"auto enthusiast\" minds about the electric transition. It's that good.\n<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Do+Electric+Cars+Offer+'Fake+Shifting%2C+Real+Fun'%3F%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F04%2F0527208%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F04%2F0527208%2Fdo-electric-cars-offer-fake-shifting-real-fun%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/12/04/0527208/do-electric-cars-offer-fake-shifting-real-fun?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23540979&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

In an interview with Defense News, Admiral Pierre Vandier, the alliance's Norfolk, Virginia-based commander for concepts and transformation, likened the idea to police CCTV cameras installed on street lights in urban trouble spots for recording evidence of crimes. \"The technology is there to make this street-lighting with USVs,\" he said, using the military's shorthand for unmanned surface vessel. Vandier said his team is in the early stages of developing an unmanned surface vessel fleet so that \"NATO can see and monitor daily its environment.\" \n\nThe first step would be to achieve this at a surface level, and then later under water... According to Vandier, the goal is to launch the drone surveillance fleet before the next NATO Summit, which will be held in the Netherlands next June. \n\nThe article notes the U.S. Navy's Task Force 59 (launched in 2021) is already \"dedicated to integrating unmanned systems and AI in the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet area of operations.\" This prompted Admiral Vandier to say the technology for an unmanned cable-watching fleet \"already exists... everything is known and sold, so it is much more a matter of adoption than technology.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=NATO+Considers+Watching+Undersea+Internet+Cables+with+a+Fleet+of+Unmanned+Boats%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F0528240%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F0528240%2Fnato-considers-watching-undersea-internet-cables-with-a-fleet-of-unmanned-boats%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/12/05/0528240/nato-considers-watching-undersea-internet-cables-with-a-fleet-of-unmanned-boats?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23542103&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

Here, its actions play out on much larger timeframes, such as weekly or monthly intervals.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe true <strong>THE-Duck</strong> is present in all major financial markets, orchestrating movements on a grand scale.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/0x1fb1816da507a669f56a866db0f7df54cc539209-ew12137.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/0x1fb1816da507a669f56a866db0f7df54cc539209-pi321cb.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/0x1fb1816da507a669f56a866db0f7df54cc539209-1c421oo.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nInterestingly, the <strong>real THE-Duck</strong> can also be observed in newer, smaller markets with high potential, such as the <strong>Bitcoin market</strong>.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/0x1fb1816da507a669f56a866db0f7df54cc539209-rq521ro.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nTo identify where the <strong>real Duck</strong> has acted, follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Focus on large capital markets and weekly charts:</strong> Look for major markets with significant liquidity.</li>\n<li><strong>Find a complete pump-and-dump cycle:</strong> Identify the full cycle, from the start of the uptrend to the final downtrend.</li>\n<li><strong>Divide the chart in half:</strong> Draw a vertical line from the price's peak, marking the trend reversal point.</li>\n<li><strong>Place an isosceles right triangle under the chart:</strong> The triangle should fit snugly beneath the uptrend section of the chart, ensuring the candlesticks don’t penetrate the triangle significantly.

By the end of the cycle, they secure a profit of <strong>75%</strong> on their total investment.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis strategy operates at an immense scale, often involving trillions of dollars. <strong>The Duck</strong> has been executing this framework since the inception of financial markets, having created this code to dominate liquidity cycles.</p>",

      "content": "<p>With Bitcoin making at all-time highs and a pro-Bitcoin administration about to take over the White House in America, I see many Bitcoiners understandably breathing a sigh of relief and celebrating. It may feel like we as a community have finally won the war and that Bitcoin is poised to take over the entire world and replace fiat currency with a Bitcoin standard. I propose, however, that we have not won the war, only a major battle. Now is not the time to become complacent and stop fighting for Bitcoin. Even with Donald Trump in the White House, you cannot forget that the state is bigger than Donald Trump, and the world is bigger than just the United States. Bitcoin's number one adversary is still what it has always been, the nation-state. Bitcoin is a direct threat to state power, which is largely derived from the state's control of the money supply. In four years, Americans may very well elect an entirely anti-Bitcoin administration, and if we spend this entire time sitting on our asses mesmerized by the \"number go up\", then we will have wasted a valuable opportunity to strengthen the Bitcoin community. We must use this reprieve to prepare for when the state inevitably decides that it wants to fight us again.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::warning\nEditor’s note: This story represents the views of the author of the story.

Don't forget that they have already thrown several people in prison for so-called \"crimes\" related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Ian Freeman, Roman Storm, Roman Semenov, Keonne Rodriguez, and William Hill are just some examples. Alexey Pertsev just got sentenced to five years in a cage in the Netherlands for deploying some immutable code in the form of a smart contract that can and was used for legitimate purposes. The illicit activity that went through Tornado Cash was a very small proportion of its overall volume. This didn't matter to the prosecutors though, in what amounts to the same kind of logic that would dictate a prison sentence for the manufacturer of a hammer that was then used for a murder. Ian Freeman is doing an 8-year prison sentence right now for simply selling Bitcoin to consenting adults. The Samourai developers are still facing prison time. Why did the state go after these individuals? The answer is simple, if you control the money you control the population, nobody can do anything without some form of money. Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and the tools to use them are all threats to this control. The state has spent decades both building a vast dystopian financial surveillance and control apparatus and simultaneously normalizing it so that the average person doesn't think twice about such things as the fact that you can't even withdraw or deposit too much of your own money without triggering a \"Suspicious Activity Report\".  There was a time not that long ago when you could open a bank account without even showing government-issued identification. By slowly introducing a myriad of laws and regulations over time, the State made it so that you need their permission to use your own money. Bitcoin fixes this. Anyone can set up a Bitcoin wallet without permission, send millions of dollars in value across the planet without permission, and build wealth outside of the state's control. This technology is an incredibly powerful countermeasure to the state's attacks on your freedom.</p>\n<p>\\\nWell, what if you have nothing to hide? Does it matter that you have to follow all the rules and regulations and that the Government can lock you out of the financial system at any time for any reason? I mean that wouldn't happen to you, right? All those laws are just designed to stop the bad guys right? Regardless of your politics, the debanking of the Canadian trucker protesters in 2022 was an important reminder that the state could use these tools to go after anyone for any reason, including simply having the wrong opinion. One of the most important parts of a free society is the right to transact freely, to be able to transfer value without the need to inform anyone or get permission. In a society in which the Government has control over your transactions, they have de facto control of your entire life. This is why having a decentralized permission-less currency and store of value like Bitcoin is absolutely essential and must be protected at all costs. In the United States and many other countries, the government wants to know exactly how much money you have, where every cent came from, and the details of every single transaction you make.</p>\n<p>\\\nThere is a reason why it's considered rude to ask a stranger how much money they make or have. People like to maintain their financial privacy because this kind of information can reveal all sorts of personal details about you. It can put your life in danger if it falls into the wrong hands, (look up “5 dollar wrench attack” if you don’t understand why) which is almost guaranteed to happen if the government is in charge of protecting it. This worldwide attack on our financial privacy and freedom has been going on for decades but has recently accelerated dramatically with the recent actions taken against Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, and the individuals and companies that are in the crypto space. So how did we get here? How did we get to the point in the supposed \"land of the free\" where people are sitting in prison for selling Bitcoin or facing prison for coding software?</p>\n<p>\\\nWell before bitcoin was even an idea, the first major blow against America's financial privacy was struck in 1970 with the passage of the Bank Secrecy Act. With the passage of this law, banks were required to file a SAR (suspicious activity report) with the government anytime a transaction over 10,000 dollars occurred. At that time, most average people probably weren't too concerned with this law because, in 1970, $10,000 was the equivalent of $80,000 of today's money in terms of purchasing power. Imagine if the law was being passed today, and the limit for filing a SAR was announced to be 80,000. It would seem more reasonable to the average person, because they might think, \"Oh well nobody ever needs that much cash anyways, unless they are doing something wrong.\" There was a country-wide increase in crime right before the passage of this bill, and the government, which never lets a good crisis go to waste, presented the Bank Secrecy Act as an important tool for fighting crime. This decades-long war on our financial privacy is a perfect example of what people mean when they say something is a slippery slope. Once they get away with passing one law that violates your privacy, it normalizes such violations and opens the door for worse violations in the future which is exactly what has happened in the years since 1970. They inflated the money but didn't ever raise the SAR limit. Now we are at a point where you can't make any kind of large transaction, legitimate or not, without having a report filed on you. One of the main ways the financial surveillance apparatus affects Bitcoin is through what are called KYC/AML regulations which stands for “Know your customer” and “Anti Money Laundering”. KYC/AML regulations are why you can’t use Binance any more if you live in the United States, they are why if you want to sign up for Coinbase or another exchange, you have to submit a selfie of you holding a photo ID. They basically make everything very complicated and ensure that any bitcoin you buy through these KYC exchanges is tied to your name until the end of time itself. They also started using civil asset forfeiture laws so that you can no longer safely travel with a large amount of cash, regardless of whether it's been procured through completely legal means or not, without the very possible risk of having every cent seized from you by predatory police officers. They steal your money to pad their pensions or buy fancy new assault rifles and body armor for their small-town police force that hasn't even had to use their SWAT team in 10 years. If that wasn't bad enough, it was recently revealed that the IRS has total access to every American citizen's bank account records without a warrant and has been using AI to sift through the data in a flagrant violation of the 4th amendment.</p>\n<p>\\\nCovid accelerated the widespread adoption of payment processors such as Paypal and Venmo instead of cash. Many people don't use cash at all anymore which is a dream come true for the government, which once again didn't let a good crisis, like Covid ,go to waste. In 2021, President Biden signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act into law which included a ridiculous provision that requires payment processors to start snitching on any American who does more than a cumulative $600 worth of transactions in a year, allowing such dystopian nonsense as taxing you three times on the same thing. You make some money, pay more than a third of it in taxes, spend the rest on a computer, get taxed with sales tax, and then when it's old and you replace it, you will now get taxed again when you sell it if the purchaser pays you via a digital payment application unless you can prove that the payment wasn't actually income. This automatic reporting switches the burden of proof from the government to you, the IRS is going to just assume every payment you get on Venmo or Paypal is income whether it is or not. For example, if you were to split a bill at a restaurant and then have your friend repay you via Venmo, their repayment will look like income to the IRS and you will be taxed on that unless you provide proof otherwise. So if you pay your taxes, you probably should start saving every single receipt you ever get.</p>\n<p>\\\nNot only does the government want to squeeze every single dollar they can out of people who are already struggling through income taxes, but they don't stop there. They tax them again with the \"secret tax\" of inflation, destroying the purchasing power of their dollars over time. Then they want to use the money they steal from you to fund more theft and violence, meaning some of your precious time that you could be spending with your loved ones is instead spent working to fund this massive extortion racket.</p>\n<p>\\\nSo what do people do when the current system is screwing them over? After a while, they usually get fed up enough to build a new system, which is exactly what Bitcoin is, the basis for an entirely new financial system that is not controlled by any centralized power. If you control the money, you control everything, which is exactly why no one should have that power. By using decentralized money such as Bitcoin, you take the immense power of money itself and spread it around so that no one group or individual has too much power. Instead of a central bank controlling the creation of bitcoin, anyone can buy a miner and start producing bitcoin on their own.</p>\n<p>\\\nUnfortunately, while governments may have mostly ignored Bitcoin in the early days, they certainly view it as a threat now. They will continue to view it as a threat even with a \"Bitcoin president\" in the United States. The Government is much larger than just Trump and there will still be elements within it that are determined to stop bitcoin, not to mention all the other governments around the world. The State's main objective is controlling the population so that it can continue to extract wealth from it, the State knows that if you have control over money itself through central banking and potentially a CBDC, then you have control over everyone that uses that money. Bitcoin is a threat to that power, the United States Government knows that if the dollar loses its status as a global reserve currency then they will lose a significant amount of power. That is why they want to throw you in jail if you dare to sell people bitcoin without a money transmitting license, but even though they can treat bitcoin as money when prosecuting you, they treat it as property when taxing you. So if you buy some bitcoin, it goes up in value, and you then buy a cup of coffee or anything with that same bitcoin, you are usually required by law to pay a ridiculous amount of capital gains taxes on that purchase because by buying the coffee you are realizing your gains on your \"investment\". If you have money, like the US dollar, and it goes up in purchasing power, and then you spend those dollars, you aren't expected to pay taxes on the gains you made by holding dollars. You also don't get to claim the losses in your dollar's purchasing power from inflation as a loss on your taxes, even though it technically is a loss. How can Bitcoin be simultaneously money and an investment in the eyes of the law depending on the situation? Well, it is based on the classic \"because we say so\" doctrine.  Unfortunately, most people are so brainwashed that they will just accept whatever new law they force upon us regardless of whether it violates their natural rights or not. The government knows they can get away with it, so they will continue to do so until there is nothing left to take from us, and until anybody with any remaining wealth and common sense has left the country leaving behind hordes of starving people pushing wheelbarrows of US dollars around to buy moldy bread with.</p>\n<p>\\\nMany people are hopeful that some kind of comprehensive cryptocurrency legislation gets passed during the Trump presidency. It is also entirely likely that they will try to put some \"common sense\" provisions in the bill that address so-called money laundering by \"criminals and terrorists\" to appease the holdouts and get the thing through Congress. It doesn't matter to politicians that a very small percentage of money laundering actually happens through crypto and instead uses traditional financial institutions. When a bank gets in trouble for helping criminals launder billions of dollars it barely makes the headlines, if some North Korean sends $10 in tether to their mother or something there will probably be congressional hearings about the dangers of cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin and crypto communities need to scrutinize every word of any bills that are put forth, you can't just assume that they will be in our best interest because of all the promises Trump has made. One of the biggest problems with passing laws that take away your freedoms in the name of fighting criminals is that who constitutes a criminal often changes on a whim in a tyrannical society. You might be okay with the law today because you believe you have nothing to worry about, that you are not one of those \"criminal\" folks, so it doesn't affect you. Unfortunately, I think I know what many Bitcoiners may be thinking when they see things like the Samourai devs getting arrested. That is, \"Well I don't mind KYC because I don't have anything to hide and the number will still go up, that's all I care about.\"  However, what if you become a criminal in the future due to the passage of yet another \"law\"? For example, drug users were just normal people, such as housewives and old soldiers, who bought drugs such as cannabis extracts over the counter in the 19th and early 20th centuries, fast forward a few decades, and cannabis users were criminals and outcasts because what was once not illegal became illegal.</p>\n<p>\\\nThere are countless other examples of this throughout history and one must always be prepared for potential criminalization by the State.  Another potent example of this is how gold was perfectly legal to own for the entire history of our country until one day the Government decided it was going to outlaw it and seize your gold. If you owned some gold, one day you were just someone with nothing to hide and the next day you were a criminal with something to hide. Eventually, this was reversed, and many people today aren't even aware that it happened but it did.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe same thing that happened with gold can happen with Bitcoin in the future, using Bitcoin is legal right now and will likely remain so at least for the entirety of a Trump presidency, but if in the future the state feels threatened enough by it they might decide to ban it just as they banned gold in the past. If you have any KYCed bitcoin, you may very well have to surrender it or face imprisonment. This may feel far-fetched and dystopian, but it is definitely within the realm of possibility especially if you consider the fact that there are already people in prison right now for simply selling bitcoin to consenting adults. Bitcoin is a threat to the State because it is freedom tech, a tool that enables freedom by being a permission-less censorship-resistant store of value. This is empowering for the individual and dis-empowering for the State because no matter who you are, where you live, or what documents you possess, you can use Bitcoin to store value and transact value.  It can be sent across the globe in minutes for a small fee without any friction. Fiat currency in cash form is also permission-less and censorship-resistant but it is not an ideal store of value because the State can manipulate its value as it sees fit through money printing. The State can get away with taxing the people through inflation as long as people continue to use their fiat currency, so it considers any alternatives such as Bitcoin to be a threat to its power and its’ monopoly on violence that is funded by the ability to create money out of thin air.  If you don't take steps to protect yourself and your bitcoin and use KYC services to buy your bitcoin, then one day you might get a knock on your door from the Government telling you to give up your private keys or go to prison. You can try to claim you lost your keys in a boating accident all day long, but I have to wonder if they will give a shit. \"Fine, you lost your keys? No problem, just pay us an equivalent amount in fiat to what you lost and you won't go to prison.\" Store and acquire your bitcoin outside of the financial system, where it belongs. Buying KYCed bitcoin, or bitcoin in an ETF means you lose one of the most important advantages of owning this asset in the first place, the ability to store wealth outside of the state-controlled financial system.</p>\n<p>\\\nDifferent governments have taken different approaches to dealing with the threat of Bitcoin, for example, the Chinese government simply banned trading bitcoin outright. The United States is taking a different approach entirely. The US Government tries to keep up the appearance of being a so-called free democratic society, so it can't just ban Bitcoin outright like China because the optics would be horrible. Instead, they are trying to do everything they can to mitigate the permission-less aspect of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by cutting off all ways to use Bitcoin and crypto without first giving up your privacy and complying with KYC/AML regulations. First, they targeted the on and off ramps into crypto (such as localbitcoins and bitcoin ATMs), so it became very hard to turn US dollars into bitcoin or sell bitcoin for US dollars without first KYCing. The Bitcoin community pushed back somewhat on this but not hard enough and it became the norm that on and off ramps in the United States became KYC only. Now they are going after self-hosted wallets and crypto to crypto exchanges and are trying to force any entities that deal with crypto or bitcoin to register with FinCen and require users to KYC/AML. The results of the US election will ensure some of the pressure is relieved temporarily but, we are most definitely not out of the woods. Personally, I doubt that Donald Trump even understands why Bitcoin is important, and I think he just decided it would win him some votes to support it.</p>\n<p>\\\nOne of the most significant recent state attacks on Bitcoin was the arrest of the Samourai Wallet developers in April. Samourai Wallet was a Bitcoin wallet app that had some great privacy features. Privacy is not easy to achieve with Bitcoin because it is a fully transparent ledger, and if you buy bitcoin through an exchange or service linked to your real name in any way, anybody can track exactly what you do with that bitcoin and how much you have. One of Samourai's main features, the one that got them arrested, was a non-custodial mixing service called Whirlpool that allowed users to mix their bitcoin with other users' bitcoin and then receive different bitcoin that wasn't linked to their original bitcoin. The government has gone after cryptocurrency mixing services before, but the main difference between Whirlpool and a mixer like Bitcoin Fog was that Whirlpool is non-custodial. Samourai Wallet never actually took possession of your bitcoin, although they did run a centralized coordinator that matched people who wanted to mix bitcoin. That wasn't illegal and still isn't regardless of what the prosecutors argue. The US Government is alleging that just because a handful of criminals used the service the developers are guilty of conspiracy to commit money laundering which is ridiculous. For one, the percentage of illicit funds that went through Whirlpool was minuscule, most people were legitimate users who just wanted to improve their privacy. This is as absurd as arresting the manager of a bank just because a few criminals managed to use the bank to launder money, or arresting a knife manufacturer because some people used their knives to commit crimes. Samourai wallet was one of the very few options people had if they wanted to use Bitcoin privately, and now that it's gone it has left a giant hole in the privacy toolkit for Bitcoiners. Now that a couple of coders are facing serious prison time for developing Bitcoin software, it has created a chilling effect throughout the industry. There are plenty of people who want to develop privacy software, but not many of them are willing to risk going to prison to do so and can you blame them? If the Samourai devs don't beat this case it will have far-reaching implications, so you might want to donate to their legal defense if you care about bitcoin, privacy, and freedom in general. There is a way to ensure privacy for Bitcoin without anyone risking prison time, and that is if changes were made at the protocol level to improve privacy. Unfortunately, there is a significant portion of the community that is against making any major changes to the Bitcoin protocol, they believe ossification is the best route. I think those who believe this are probably more concerned with the price of Bitcoin than whether it succeeds or fails in offering a viable alternative to the state-controlled financial system.</p>\n<p>\\\nWe are at a crossroads with Bitcoin, there are multiple paths before us. One path is the one in which crypto and bitcoin become absorbed into the traditional financial system as heavily regulated investments accessible only to those privileged enough to have the proper paperwork, and taxed to the point where their price appreciation and wealth preservation effects are heavily mitigated.  You will be able to buy bitcoin only from licensed AML/KYC-compliant custodians and self-custody will likely be illegal. Perhaps USDC and USDT are co-opted as a de facto CBDC, after all, it makes sense for the US government to allow stablecoins as long as they follow all their rules because the use of those stablecoins will help prevent the dollar from losing its reserve currency status. Another more unlikely path is a total ban on cryptocurrency and bitcoin use in the United States and the European Union. If you are unlucky enough in this scenario to have any KYCed BTC that the government knows about, it will be seized from you. If you have custody and you refuse to give up your keys, they will just throw you in prison for disobeying. The third path is the one I hope we take, in which we successfully fight back against government regulations and preserve Bitcoin's ability to be a permission-less system outside of the traditional financial system. The division in the space between bitcoin maximalists and users of other cryptocurrencies needs to be put aside, no longer should BTC maxis cheer when the SEC takes down another \"shitcoin\" company, but instead all lovers of freedom and users of cryptocurrency need to band together and use our influence and wealth to do everything we can to stop the government from destroying our freedom to transact and our right to privacy. As a group, united, we have the power to make a difference. It is important to remember that the Government is not some all-powerful eye of Sauron, they are just people who think they have some divine right to tell other people what they can and can't do because of some words on a piece of paper. We can peacefully fight back in a myriad of ways and stop this madness in its tracks. I know a lot of people in the community would prefer to just pretend like nothing is happening as long as the number goes up, but even if Bitcoin gets to a million dollars, if we are not free to use it in whatever way we wish, then that would be a phallic victory.  Regardless of any regulation that does or does not pass, we must fulfill the mission of Bitcoin and create and participate in a massive circular Bitcoin and crypto economy outside of the blood money fiat system. It needs to be relatively easy for someone to live off of Bitcoin alone without any need for KYCed offramps. We need landlords who will rent to plebs for bitcoin, we need plumbers who will fix your toilet for bitcoin, and we need a network of people all over the world who will readily accept and spend bitcoin for products and services. With localbitcoins getting shut down, private word-of-mouth networks using encrypted communications and mesh networking need to develop and grow rapidly. Many people are working on this but we need more and we need it now.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf you believe in the promise of Bitcoin, in the power of money that is separated from the state, and in freedom tech; then it's time to support your local circular Bitcoin economy. The main reason I am writing this is as a call to action for all those who consider themselves aligned with Bitcoin's values, maxis or not. If you buy Bitcoin, for whatever purpose, then I implore you to stop only buying KYCed bitcoin! There are those of us, myself included, who have taken the plunge and dropped out of the traditional financial system. We earn and save in Bitcoin instead of fiat. Some of us don't even have a bank account, let alone a Coinbase account or any account that requires KYC. I have never KYCed and will never KYC. At first, this wasn't because I understood why KYC and Bitcoin were antithetical, but because I was so broke I didn't even have an ID in 2017 when I first got into the space. I had to learn how to acquire BTC without using Coinbase or other KYC exchanges. Eventually, as I learned more about Bitcoin, I realized that my inability to KYC onto Coinbase was a positive thing.</p>\n<p>\\\nSticking to my principles and trying to live outside of the traditional system does present some challenges from time to time. For now, I do still need access to Fiat to pay my rent and other expenses. I can buy gift cards for food and other products, and virtual prepaid debit cards work for my utility bills. Unfortunately, I can not pay my rent with a virtual prepaid debit card. Also, to preserve my privacy, I have to first convert the bitcoin into monero, a cryptocurrency with built in privacy, to buy the prepaid debit card. Otherwise, if I pay my power bill or something under my name with it, I am doxxing my Bitcoin wallet. The options for converting Bitcoin or other crypto to fiat without KYCing are decreasing every single day. Hell, the options for simply converting stablecoins to Bitcoin without KYCing are also decreasing rapidly as more and more exchanges require KYC.</p>\n<p>\\\nMy local Bitcoin meet-up has been a lifeline, I can go there and sometimes find someone willing to buy Bitcoin with cash. If I'm really lucky I will find someone who will buy Bitcoin from me regularly. This is never 100% reliable, and there are times when I desperately need fiat and can't find any buyers. It is incredibly frustrating to have plenty of bitcoin and still not be able to pay my bills. I heard someone talking at a meetup recently, they were asking questions about non-KYC versus KYC bitcoin. They mentioned how fond they were of using Swan to make regular purchases of bitcoin with the classic dollar cost-averaging investing strategy. I get it, it's simple, it's easy. It is way easier to just click a button on your phone to acquire sats than to have to buy it from someone in person with cash. It's important to realize though, that every single time you \"smash buy\" on your KYCed app, not only are you compromising on your privacy, you are wasting another chance to help a fellow bitcoiner and strengthen your local circular economy.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf even half of the people who attend my local meeting choose to buy KYC-free bitcoin for cash every time or even every other time they make a purchase instead of using some app, I would never again have to worry about whether or not there would be a buyer if that was the case. This is the easiest way you can fight back against government overreach,  just as the Bitcoin network itself gets stronger and more secure as more people use it, so does the Bitcoin circular economy. If you are in Bitcoin for more than just a \"number go up\" investment, I feel that you are doing a disservice to the Bitcoin community every time you have the means and ability to purchase bitcoin from a pleb and instead choose to take the easy route and click buy on some app that's probably reporting everything you do to the government. The Bitcoin community has a lot of combined economic power, there is no reason why we shouldn't be directing some of that purchasing power inward to strengthen our community. By buying our bitcoin from within our community, the power and reach of our circular economy would increase drastically and be much harder to stop. They can't blacklist your Bitcoin wallet address if they don't know what it is! They can't freeze your bank account if you don't have to use one! Imagine a world in which one could easily live outside of their system, and opt out of their game. I'm not telling you not to pay your taxes, because that can end with you in a prison cell and then you are out of the fight. But you don't have to dox your Bitcoin wallet just to pay taxes on your gains.</p>\n<p>\\\nYes, I'm sure it's nice to just set up an automatic dollar cost average weekly or monthly buy on Swan or on any of the many other options for this. Just set it and forget it they tell you, it's so easy when you don't even have to think about it! Watch your stack grow and grow over time on your little app. Well, you know what? Screw that! Freedom isn't \"easy\", freedom isn't \"convenient\", freedom is hard work, freedom is blood, sweat, and tears, and freedom is sacrifice. The State loves every time you pick what's easy and convenient over what is best for your freedom. If Bitcoin is ever going to succeed as an alternative financial system, then it does need to be easier to do more with it than buying some maple syrup or paying your VPN subscription. Since the state is trying to close all the non-kyc on/off ramps, it is imperative that our community provides our own on/off ramps for those who need some dirty, dirty fiat, to survive. Buying your bitcoin from a Bitcoiner in need is a way to advocate for freedom with your purchasing power. Please for the love of god, it's up to us. If we don't fight back with our collective purchasing power, Bitcoin will become just another speculative investment and nothing more.</p>\n<p>\\\nSo how do we use the next four years to make the Bitcoin community and network more resilient to potential future attacks from the state? We have to create a massive grassroots movement to create new and strengthen existing circular economies outside of state control using Bitcoin. We have to strengthen Bitcoin's privacy and create new tools to enable people to use Bitcoin as privately as possible. We have to support and use non-kyc services, and support the people developing and maintaining non-kyc services and Bitcoin privacy tech.  You may not feel that you, as just one individual, have much power to change things. This is not true at all, if everyone in Bitcoin does some or all of the things I am about to list, then collectively we have the power to regain our freedom and protect it.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"fivewaysyoucanfightbackagainstthegovernmentswaronbitcoin\">Five ways you can fight back against the Government's war on Bitcoin</h2>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Buy your bitcoin without KYC from plebs, not KYC/AML exchanges.</strong> Every time you buy bitcoin from Coinbase or something, it is a wasted opportunity. If you are actively stacking sats, whether you are dollar cost averaging regularly, or just buying now and then when you can, then you need to be viewing every purchase as an opportunity to help support the Bitcoin circular economy. If you are buying your bitcoin on a KYC exchange or service, then you are wasting an opportunity and helping the bad guys win. Yes, it can be more inconvenient to buy Bitcoin without KYC instead of just pressing a button on a KYCed app, but if you truly believe in the freedom that Bitcoin represents, that's what you should be doing. I can understand if you want to have a KYC stack and non-KYC stack, especially if you are public about your involvement with Bitcoin, but at least make some of your purchases off the books. This is not legal or tax advice, but as far as I know, it is not illegal to simply buy bitcoin and not report the purchase. It's only when you sell it that you are required to report any capital gains. If you already have any KYCed bitcoin that you have an unrealized loss on, you might want to consider selling it immediately for cash, realizing the loss for your taxes, and then take that cash and buy non-kyced bitcoin from a fellow pleb at a meetup. You don't want to wait until you're sitting on a huge gain and it would require a large tax bill to do this, also this wash trading loophole for crypto might not be around forever. You can't do that with stocks, if you sell a stock at a loss and then buy it back within a certain amount of time, it is considered \"wash trading\", and you are unable to write the loss off your taxes. This is not currently the case for cryptocurrencies, so you might want to take advantage of it.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Spread the word.</strong> Normies need to know about the assault on their freedoms, it goes beyond bitcoin or crypto. You may think you are just one voice, and maybe you don't have thousands of followers on social media, so can you make a difference in this battle? It's important that we all use what reach we do have to spread the word about the assault on our rights by governments around the world. I doubt the average person, even if they might own a little bitcoin, even knows what's going on. If they do have an idea, they probably don't realize the full extent of it. You need to tell everyone who will listen to you that governments are attacking our rights and that we are so close to living in a completely dystopian nightmare if we don't do something to stop it now. Explain to your friends and family the truth about what inflation is and what causes it. We must find a way to inform the average person how the state's assault on financial privacy and freedom affects them personally whether they use Bitcoin or not. We need the support of the average Joe who doesn't necessarily care about Bitcoin but still doesn't like the idea of the Government tracking everything they do with their money. It should creep people out when they are told about how the government now watches everything you do financially and is even examining bank account transactions with AI and without a warrant. Education is important because currently many people aren't even aware of what fiat currency means, that the gold standard is gone, or that price inflation isn't a result of corporate greed. The Federal Reserve means nothing to average people and neither does the advantages of having a decentralized permission-less store of value. This has to change, the Government is getting away with acts of tyranny, like locking up people for writing code, partly because many people outside of our community have no idea it's going on or its implications. We have to get the public angry about this! It might be uncomfortable talking about these kinds of issues with normie friends and family (if you still have any normie friends), and many hesitate because they don't want to come across as some kind of radical anti-government conspiracy theorist type. Get over that hesitation though, because this is that important and they need to know the truth.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Use your wealth and purchasing power. Use services and products that accept Bitcoin/crypto payments, and offer your own services and products in return for Bitcoin. Donate to pro-crypto candidates and Bitcoin/privacy developers.</strong> Every time you can spend bitcoin on products and services. Offer your own products and services in exchange for bitcoin. List items on bitcoin marketplaces. Donate to organizations and campaigns that are fighting for Bitcoin, or developers that are working on it. Bitcoin has generated a lot of wealth for a lot of people, and if it has benefited you, now is the time to give some back to support this fight. If a dev gets arrested, they should know the community is going to rally around them and they are going to have good lawyers. We need to play the game in Washington as well with lobbyists and the whole nine yards, yes it is disgusting to participate in this system to any degree but until a new system takes its place we may have to. Many anarcho-capitalists consider the very act of voting to be immoral, which I get because you are trying to impose your will on others by voting. But they are playing dirty my friends, so we might have to get dirty ourselves.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Help normalize privacy by using tools to protect your privacy and encourage family and friends to do the same, the bigger the herd the better otherwise the very act of using a privacy tool makes you stand out, negating some of the benefits.</strong> If only a few people are using tools and services to protect their privacy, the very act of using that tool or service makes you stand out. We need the protection of the crowd, if everyone is using privacy tools, then it no longer is a weird thing to be doing. Just because you may have nothing to hide doesn't mean you shouldn't protect your privacy regardless. For example, a lot of services and websites are blocking VPN users these days, but if the majority of people were all using VPNs, they would be committing suicide as a business by blocking VPNS. It's also important to support open-source software developers who are working on privacy tools. Many people who bought KYCed bitcoin on centralized platforms and then wanted to gain some forward privacy relied on tools such as Samourai Wallet, but if the Government isn't going to allow such tools to operate, it's more important than ever to protect your privacy in other ways. The easiest way to ensure BTC privacy is to stop buying Bitcoin on centralized exchanges and services, if you buy bitcoin directly from other plebs and especially home miners, and that Bitcoin is never deposited into a KYCed account, you don't even have to worry about trying to use mixers. Another way is to use Monero to break the link between your bitcoin and you. Monero as a tool for spending bitcoin is more valuable than ever before, I believe that Monero can become the de facto privacy layer of Bitcoin. Until major changes are made to the Bitcoin protocol to improve privacy, then it will remain a good strategy to save in bitcoin and spend in monero.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Work together and join forces, bitcoiners and shitcoiners have to work together against the assualt on our freedoms.</strong> Crypto is a very tribal community, you got your Bitcoin maxis, you got your ETH maxis, and you got random shitcoin communities who think their coin is the best coin or whatever. That's all fine and good, but it is past time to work together to stop attacks on crypto, what's bad for crypto in general is bad for Bitcoin. For a long time, many bitcoin maximalists espoused the opinion that what was bad for shitcoins was good for bitcoin. They would cheer on the SEC when it went after shitcoin projects because they thought bitcoin wasn't considered a security so it was \"safe\" and money would just flow out of targeted shitcoins into Bitcoin. Cheering on tyrannical government intervention because it might have the side effect of making your bags go up is antithetical to everything Bitcoin stands for. Many people tried to warn them, that bitcoin wasn't by any means \"safe\" just because it wasn't a security, and that the government would find other ways to attack bitcoin outside of securities laws. Now that scenario is playing out and it's time for maximalists to hold their nose and ally themselves with the rest of crypto against the government's war on crypto. This is taking some time to sink in apparently for some people like the host of a Bitcoin maxi podcast I won't name. They were saying that they would rather elect Elizabeth Warren over John Deaton because he is a \"shitcoiner\". When I heard this, I was flabbergasted. This person was willing to put Bitcoin in more danger from an avowed anti-crypto politician like Warren just so they didn't have to support a shitcoiner who is also going to be pro bitcoin. I mean come on, can you get over your hatred of shitcoiners for five minutes please! If we don't work together then we are going to be destroyed eventually. There is no more time for infighting and pseudo-religious maximalism. If you hate shitcoins, repeat after me, \"The enemy of my enemy is my friend\". I don't care if you are the worst ponzi-shilling, ugly NFT bag-holding, grifter, scumbag, and pump and dumper, if you are going to help stop this madness then I will work with you all day long (well maybe not someone like Sam Bankman Fried). Working together includes voting for pro-crypto candidates regardless of your views on shitcoins or voting. Although as they say, democracy is just two wolves and a sheep deciding what's for dinner(attribute quote), we might as well cast self-defense votes on candidates that are pro-crypto.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>When I first started writing this article, things were looking a lot more dire for Bitcoin than they are today. We have a pro-Bitcoin president for the first time in history and our Congress will be much more pro-Bitcoin than it was as well. Politicians will say anything to get elected though, and it's important to remember that. At the end of the day, Trump and other pro-crypto candidates are still politicians and statists who probably don't give a shit about your freedom beyond winning your votes. Even if Trump follows through on the promises he's making regarding cryptocurrency, it will only be a temporary reprieve in the overall war. The state knows Bitcoin is a threat to it, and whatever administration comes after Trump might not be nearly as friendly to the industry. So if the assault on crypto does cool off with a Trump presidency, it will be an opportunity to strengthen our community, shore up our defenses, and ensure that a strong circular economy is up and running outside of the traditional financial system. This way when the state inevitably attacks us again, whether it be in 4 years or 10 years, we will be ready for them. I know it can be tempting to just sit back, watch your bags grow in value, and let other people worry about fighting for freedom. However, we need your help, we need every single person's help that we can get or we will lose. You don't have to be fighting all day every day, but do something! Many of the things on the list above are very simple for anyone to do and don't require much effort, but if enough people do them it can make a significant impact. We have the power, we just have to use it.</p>",

After the [January 25] deadline, U.S. app stores and internet services could face hefty fines for hosting TikTok if it is not sold. (Under the legislation, President Biden may issue a one-time extension of the deadline.) \n\n In a statement, TikTok indicated it would appeal the decision. \"The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" said company spokesperson Michael Hughes. \"Unfortunately, the TikTok ban was conceived and pushed through based upon inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information, resulting in outright censorship of the American people. The TikTok ban, unless stopped, will silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in the US and around the world on January 19th, 2025\".... \n\"People in the United States would remain free to read and share as much PRC propaganda (or any other content) as they desire on TikTok or any other platform of their choosing,\" the judges said. \"What the Act targets is the PRC's ability to manipulate the content covertly. Understood in that way, the Government's justification is wholly consonant with the First Amendment.\" \nThe judges also wrote that \"in part precisely because of the platform's expansive reach, Congress and multiple Presidents determined that divesting it from the PRC's control is essential to protect our national security... Congress judged it necessary to assume that risk given the grave national-security threats it perceived.\" \n\n\nCNN notes that ByteDance \"has previously indicated it will not sell TikTok.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=TikTok+is+One+Step+Closer+to+Being+Banned+in+the+US%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F06%2F1857243%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F06%2F1857243%2Ftiktok-is-one-step-closer-to-being-banned-in-the-us%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/12/06/1857243/tiktok-is-one-step-closer-to-being-banned-in-the-us?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23543833&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

Recent developments, such as the token generation event (TGE) of the $ZRC token, have increased attention on the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>\\\nOcelex’s launch will leverage this momentum to establish itself as Zircuit’s primary decentralized exchange, prioritizing liquidity, accessibility, and growth within the DeFi sector.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ocelexasthefirstlynexexpansion\">Ocelex as the First Lynex Expansion</h3>\n<p>As the first franchise expansion of Lynex—the leading liquidity protocol on Linea—Ocelex builds on a proven foundation. Lynex has achieved over $3.5 billion in trading volume and distributed $7.5 million in revenue to token holders, positioning it as one of the top-performing ve(3,3) DEXs. </p>\n<p>\\\nOcelex continues this legacy by introducing Automated Liquidity Management (ALM) aggregation, a feature designed to simplify liquidity management through automated strategies. This approach reduces risks like impermanent loss while ensuring consistent yield for liquidity providers (LPs).</p>\n<h3 id=\"strategicpartnershipsandprelaunchmomentum\">Strategic Partnerships and Pre-Launch Momentum</h3>\n<p>Even before its official launch, Ocelex has established key partnerships and secured significant Total Value Locked (TVL). These partnerships include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>EtherFi, Kelp, and Renzo for LRTs (liquidity restaking tokens).</li>\n<li>Lido and StakeStone for LSTs (liquid staking tokens).</li>\n<li>StakeStone and Elara, two leading money market protocols to ensure seamless, integrated liquidity flows for users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nOcelex’s strong pre-launch performance underscores its potential to play a key role in Zircuit’s ecosystem growth. With a <strong><a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocol/ocelex\">current TVL of $4.6M</a></strong> and total trading volume of $13.3M, Ocelex has already secured a solid foothold in the DEX category.</p>\n<h3 id=\"acommunityfirstapproach\">A Community-First Approach</h3>\n<p>Ocelex follows Lynex’s community-centric strategy with an airdrop that prioritizes long-term alignment. 45% of Ocelex’s initial supply will be airdropped to Lynex veLYNX holders who have locked tokens for one year or more.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis approach rewards loyal participants while fostering ecosystem stability. Locking veLYNX has historically provided some of the <strong><a href=\"https://x.com/LynexFi/status/1850128224010793175\">most consistent yields</a></strong> among ve(3,3) protocols, a trend Ocelex aims to replicate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"theupcomingpublicsale\">The Upcoming Public Sale</h3>\n<p>The Ocelex public sale begins on December 9th at 10:00 UTC and will run for 60 hours in a Dutch auction format. The auction ensures fair market pricing, starting at $0.30 and decreasing to $0.06.</p>\n<p>Key Sale Details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tokens for Sale: 2,000,000 $OCX (2% of initial supply).</li>\n<li>Minimum Price: $0.06 | Starting Price: $0.30.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Following the sale, the Token Generation Event (TGE) will commence, marking the start of liquidity mining and distributing tokens to pre-miners and airdrop recipients.</p>\n<p>For a comprehensive overview of the public sale, refer to this <strong><a href=\"https://x.com/OcelexFi/status/1863687551472500790\">article</a></strong> or watch the accompanying <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5JTamL6SmLI\">short video</a></strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ocelexpublicsaleprojections\">Ocelex Public Sale Projections</h3>\n<p>Ocelex’s Dutch auction public sale lets the market decide its valuation and launch price, starting at $0.30 and decreasing linearly to $0.06.</p>\n<p>\\\nCommunity airdrop recipients, who will receive 50% of the initial supply as governance tokens, also stand to benefit from higher sale prices. With interest in Ocelex as the next big ve(3,3) DEX on Zircuit, the auction is expected to be highly competitive, following in the footsteps of Lynex, Aerodrome, and Thena.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ocelexsgrowthpotential\">Ocelex’s Growth Potential</h3>\n<p>Ocelex has the potential to secure substantial TVL on Zircuit, a network with over $2.5B in total value locked (TVL). This potential is modeled on the success of other ve(3,3) protocols:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aerodrome: Secured 41.56% of Base’s $3.85B TVL ($1.6B), with an FDV of $2.5B. Ocelex could achieve $1.039B TVL with a similar share.</li>\n<li>Lynex: Commands 4.7% of Linea’s $494M TVL ($23.2M) with an FDV of $29M. Ocelex could secure $117.5M TVL with comparable performance.</li>\n<li>Thena: Captures 1.47% of BNB Chain’s $5.8B TVL ($85M) with an FDV of $565M. Ocelex could achieve $36.75M TVL with this share.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"ocelexkeymetrics\">Ocelex Key Metrics:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Dominant Case: $1.039B TVL (41.56%).</li>\n<li>Moderate Case: $117.5M TVL (4.7%).</li>\n<li>Conservative Case: $36.75M TVL (1.47%).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With an FDV range of $6M to $30M, Ocelex presents an undervalued opportunity for early participants, particularly when compared to Aerodrome’s $2.5B FDV or Thena’s $565M.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe Future of DeFi with Ocelex and Zircuit</p>\n<p>Ocelex combines Lynex’s successful model with Zircuit’s technical infrastructure, aiming to serve as a cornerstone for DeFi activity. With strong pre-launch momentum, strategic partnerships, and a focus on community alignment, Ocelex is positioned to deliver value and scalability for users and the broader DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"aboutocelex\">About Ocelex</h3>\n<p>Ocelex is the first expansion of the Lynex brand, launching as a franchise on Zircuit, an emerging Layer 2.

Trend Inflation Volatility</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"abstract\">Abstract</h2>\n<p>In this paper, a mathematically rigorous solution overturns existing wisdom regarding New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium. I develop a formal concept of stochastic equilibrium. I prove uniqueness and necessity, when agents are patient, across a wide class of dynamic stochastic models. Existence depends on appropriately specified eigenvalue conditions. Otherwise, no solution of any kind exists. I construct the equilibrium for the benchmark Calvo New Keynesian. I provide novel comparative statics with the non-stochastic model of independent mathematical interest. I uncover a bifurcation between neighbouring stochastic systems and approximations taken from the Zero Inflation Non-Stochastic Steady State (ZINSS). The correct Phillips curve agrees with the zero limit from the trend inflation framework. It contains a large lagged inflation coefficient and a small response to expected inflation. The response to the output gap is always muted and is zero at standard parameters. A neutrality result is presented to explain why and to align Calvo with Taylor pricing. Present and lagged demand shocks enter the Phillips curve so there is no Divine Coincidence and the system is identified from structural shocks alone. The lagged inflation slope is increasing in the inflation response, embodying substantive policy trade-offs. The Taylor principle is reversed, inactive settings are necessary for existence, pointing towards inertial policy. The observational equivalence idea of the Lucas critique is disproven. The bifurcation results from the breakdown of the constraints implied by lagged nominal rigidity, associated with cross-equation cancellation possible only at ZINSS. This creates a singular surface inside which the inter-temporal transmission mechanism breaks down and the error terms cancel out. There is a dual relationship between restrictions on the econometrician and constraints on repricing firms. Thus if the model is correct, goodness of fit will jump.</p>\n<p>\\\nKey Words: Stochastic Equilibrium, Mean Field Game, Bifurcation Analysis, Phillips Curve, Econometric Duality, Lucas Critique, Macroeconometrics, Monetary Policy Rules, Divine Coincidence.</p>\n<p>\\\nJEL Classifications: B22, C02, C50, C52, C61, C62, C65, D50, E12, E17, E31, E52.</p>\n<p>\\\nAMS Classifications: (Primary) 91B51, (Secondary) 41A99, 49A80, 54H25, 57R55, 60B99, 62M99, 91A15, 91A16, 91A50, 91B02, 91B50, 91B51, 91B52.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.16214.pdf\">available on arxiv</a> under CC 4.0 license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>",

Trend Inflation Volatility</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"1introduction\">1 Introduction</h2>\n<p>Empirical understanding in macroeconomics has made great strides over recent years. A growing body of model-free evidence shows that price and wage rigidity are ubiquitous. This is borne out by many micro-econometric studies of price adjustment such as Alvarez et al. [2006], Dhyne et al. [2006], Gagnon [2009], Klenow and Malin [2010], Vermeulen et al. [2012], Berardi et al. [2015] and Kehoe and Midrigan [2015],[1] whilst individual wages adjust slowly with particular resistance to nominal reductions, as found for example by Fehr and Goette [2005], Dickens et al. [2007], Barattieri et al. [2014], Kaur [2019] and Grigsby et al. [2021]. A variety of quasi-natural experiments reveal that aggregate demand shocks are quantitatively important business cycle drivers (see Auerbach and Gorodnichenko [2012b], Auerbach and Gorodnichenko [2012a], Auerbach and Gorodnichenko [2013], Bils et al. [2013], Acconcia et al. [2014], Mian and Sufi [2014], Chodorow-Reich and Karabarbounis [2016] and ChodorowReich et al. [2019]). Monetary policy shocks can have large and possibly longlasting impacts on output- (see Christiano et al. [1999], Romer and Romer [2004], Velde [2009], Gertler and Karadi [2015], Jordà et al. [2020a], Jordà et al. [2020b], and Palma [2022]).</p>\n<p>\\\nThis work has bolstered the New Neo-Classical Synthesis discussed in Goodfriend and King [1997] and Snowdon and Vane [2005]. The idea is to analyze monetary policy by adding sticky prices or frictional adjustment into otherwise standard optimizing models from the Real Business Cycle (RBC) tradition. The goal has been to generate credible micro-founded complements to the aggregate demand and aggregate supply equations of Old Keynesian economics.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn this goal the literature has so far failed. Inflation, surely the key variable in New Keynesian economics, is excessively forward-looking, in fact under the current benchmark model it has no intrinsic persistence and is not identified without entirely ad hoc shocks. Moreover, there appears no short run trade-off between inflation and employment or output stabilization christened the Divine Coincidence by Blanchard and Galí [2007] so central banks can \"fine-tune\" away any inefficient fluctuations.[2] I show that all these findings are a figment of erroneous solutions to the benchmark Calvo model. The task of this paper is to construct the simplest possible correct formulation of New Keynesian economics that can serve as a platform for future theoretical, empirical and mathematical work.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe paper has three complementary tasks. The first is to uncover the dynamic properties of the New Keynesian Phillips curve. The second is to sketch its major econometric implications and theoretical rationale. Lastly, I will analyze whether and under what conditions a solution to a DSGE exists and provide precise parametric answers for the benchmark model.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe benchmark New Keynesian Phillips obtained by linearizing the Calvo model at ZINSS does not represent the dynamical properties of the underlying stochastic system however small shocks are. Except for price dispersion dynamics at ZINSS are forward-looking to all orders of approximation. By contrast, the underlying non-linear system is persistent with probability one, featuring lags of inflation and shock terms. It is already known that a hybrid system pertains when there is non-zero trend inflation- (see Damjanovic and Nolan [2010], Coibion and Gorodnichenko [2011], Ascari and Sbordone [2014] and Kurozumi and Van Zandweghe [2017] and Qureshi and Ahmad [2021]). This can be formalized as the Non-Stochastic Bifurcation by considering limits of the linear approximation as inflation goes to zero. I demonstrate Stochastic Bifurcation by showing that when inflation is precisely zero neighboring stochastic systems have equivalent dynamic properties, so trend inflation describes behavior around ZINSS.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe correct solution requires backward substitution steps, which is where the lag terms appear. The difference between the two systems is called a wallcrossing singularity. Formally, the boundary between the two solutions of the benchmark model is a two dimensional surface with a one dimensional wall leading into a three dimensional hole. Informally, it is formed by equating the differing steps between the two solutions and integrating. The wall is the inflation equality that is necessary to place the economy inside the singular surface. The second component is an equality connecting inflation, lagged and present marginal costs, reflecting a backward substitution step missing at ZINSS. It reflects the inter-temporal substitution motive present under staggered optimization and thus a change in the monetary transmission mechanism. It introduces a cost-push channel into the Phillips curve, so the Central Bank or financial conditions directly influence the pricing decisions of firms. The third dimension of the (inner) hole represents the cancellation of the demand shock with its lag.</p>\n<p>\\\nThese changes seem to fit a wide variety of existing evidence. Barth III and Ramey [2001], Gaiotti and Secchi [2006] and Chowdhury et al. [2006] provide impressive support for a cost channel of monetary policy. These forces seem to be particularly strong for firms under financial distress according to Antoun de Almeida [2015], Gilchrist et al. [2017], Meinen and Roehe [2018], Palmén [2020], Abbate et al. [2023] and Montero and Urtasun [2021].[3] The impact on the coefficients of the Phillips curve are dramatic. The responsiveness of inflation to the output gap drops, typically from close to one to around zero. The lagged inflation coefficient is always larger than that of expected inflation. These results accord with recent empirical estimates including Fuhrer [2006], Mavroeidis et al. [2014], Ball and Mazumder [2020], Hindrayanto et al. [2019], Bobeica and Jarociński [2019], Hooper et al. [2020], Zobl and Ertl [2021] and Ball and Mazumder [2021].[4] [5]</p>\n<p>\\\nAll the analysis is underpinned by a rigorous theory of stochastic equilibrium derived from ergodic theory, the branch of mathematics concerned with the longterm behavior of dynamical systems. A stochastic equilibrium is the state of the economy today that implies the probability of any future event is equal to its long-run (time) average. Crucially, I am able to construct this equilibrium explicitly.</p>\n<p>\\\nA large literature exists in economics and related disciplines that uses the theory of ergodic processes to prove existence and often uniqueness also, of general equilibrium (see for example Stokey [1989], Hopenhayn [1992], Hopenhayn and Prescott [1992], Stachurski [2002], Li and Stachurski [2014], Kamihigashi and Stachurski [2016], Brumm et al. [2017], Açıkgöz [2018], Borovička and Stachurski [2020], Marinacci and Montrucchio [2019], Kirkby [2019], Hu and Shmaya [2019], Light and Weintraub [2022] and Pohl et al. [2023]). All of these results are confined to small models lacking features, such as endogenous capital and labor accumulation or nominal rigidity, of primary interest to applied macroeconomists.[6] This paper is the first to precisely define the long-run equilibrium conditions for a nonlinear stochastic model with no closed form solution, in variables of immediate economic interest. None have addressed criticality the possibility that if a model does not meet certain conditions it does not have any solution.</p>\n<p>\\\nI supply wide-ranging comparative statics under weak assumptions. Unlike previous results, that rely on global restrictions, mine leverage the stochastic equilibrium which allows me to deduce global characteristics from local properties of the steady state.[7] Moreover, I am able to undertake novel experiments, comparing any stochastic steady state with its non-stochastic counterpart. Its mathematical significance is addressed in the next section. More progress in this area may come as a byproduct of stronger ties with mathematics.</p>\n<p>\\\nMacroeconomists have long been aware that approximations taken at nonstochastic steady states might not be accurate or dynamically representative, in particular when considering financial markets and risk premia. Since Coeurdacier et al. [2011] and Juillard [2011] it has been common to include the effect of higher order deviation terms when calculating equilibrium from which perturbations are analyzed. The main focus has naturally been on financial markets and the movements of risk premia in particular. Ascari et al. [2018b] is the most notable New Keynesian thus far. The concept of stochastic equilibrium here formalizes and clarifies these ideas.</p>\n<p>\\\nStochastic equilibrium constitutes a full probabilistic description of an economy. This gives them an intrinsic uniqueness property for systems driven by continuous shocks. This extends to the the probabilistic future path, which corresponds with the definition of recursive equilibrium in previous New Keynesian economics and the infinite time solution of mean-field game with common noise in mathematics. I also prove an equivalent finite dimensional state space form exists for benchmark New Keynesian models, comparable to previous definitions from classical economics (see Prescott and Mehra [1980] and Mehra [2006]). This technique is crucial to the analysis here and is bound to have wide application.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis striking result comes however with a powerful converse. Models that macroeconomists previously thought had multiple equilibria in fact have none. In particular for a standard class of DSGE models, when the limiting value of a linear approximation around its stochastic equilibrium is indeterminate, what is actually happening is that the expectations of one or more of the forward-looking variables in the underlying non-linear model is exploding. This is because the underlying optimization will blow up and welfare will collapse whenever the model is expected to reach one of the boundaries. This point is more obvious when there are too many eigenvalues outside the unit circle and a state variable drives the blow-up. In fact, this is the only barrier to a solution of the Calvo model around ZINSS, overturning current wisdom. In these situations we should think of the DSGE model as being misspecified, in the same way that econometricians see a correlation between non-stationary variables as statistically spurious.[8]</p>\n<p>\\\nThe result reinterprets the well-known Blanchard and Kahn [1980] eigenvalue conditions. The requirement for existence of a solution to the non-linear model is the uniqueness condition evaluated around the stochastic steady state. My approach generalizes existing linearization techniques. The non-stochastic linear approximation is the limit of the stochastic approximation as shocks become arbitrarily small. Therefore existing linearization techniques are generically (away from bifurcation points) correct, confirming the existing intuition from a different asymptotic experiment. Away from the small noise limit, the stochastic linear approximation features stochastic coefficients. This is because the derivative at the stochastic steady state features expectations of non-linear functions. This creates novel technical challenges, which I discuss. Simplicity and comparability with past work motivate focus on small noise limits, in the quantitative part.</p>\n<p>\\\nContrary to current opinion, Rotemberg and Calvo are never equivalent in stochastic equilibrium. In fact, there are no settings for the standard policy rule where both exist. This is because Rotemberg is unaffected by the singularity impacting Calvo. This equivalence was the primary motivation for using Rotemberg pricing, although, it does mean that results derived under the existing benchmark could be viewed as pertaining to the Rotemberg model. This, rather than the effect of high order terms, is the likely explanation for differences in performance under global solution methods (see Leith and Liu [2016]).</p>\n<p>\\\nA double limit system emerges depending on whether price dispersion is regarded as first or second order around ZINSS. This situation is called polydromy. First order price dispersion (∆) reflects a volatile policy regime. The non-volatile regime emerges when average shocks are very small. More broadly, ∆ can be viewed as real rigidity- in the sense of Ball and Romer [1990]- the effect of price rigidity on the flexible economy. This suggests that nominal rigidity alone might be sufficient for modelling inflation dynamics, overturning a current of thought starting with Ball and Romer [1991].</p>\n<p>\\\nIf we are prepared to focus on the neighborhood of ZINSS then an advantage of my approach over trend inflation is that I can downplay or remove entirely the role of price dispersion. At empirically relevant values, price dispersion is increasing and convex in inflation. Stochastic equilibrium worsens the problem, consistent with the empirical estimates from DSGE models (see Ascari et al. [2018b]). However, microeconomic evidence typically suggests a much more muted relationship between price dispersion and inflation at low positive levels (see Gagnon [2009], Coibion et al. [2015], Wulfsberg [2016], Nakamura et al. [2018], Alvarez et al. [2018], Sheremirov [2020], Anayi et al. [2022] and Adam et al. [2023]). Broadly, consistent with these results, if price dispersion arises in the linear approximation around ZINSS it is independent of the first order dynamics of inflation. Furthermore, the approximation will be less forward-looking than its positive trend inflation counterpart (Ascari and Sbordone [2014]). A small literature has developed that looks at extensions of the benchmark model that give less extreme predictions concerning nominal dispersion (see Bakhshi et al. [2007], Kurozumi [2016], Kurozumi and Van Zandweghe [2016] and Hahn [2022]). Together they may justify considering an inflation rate closer to zero than for example the common Central Bank inflation target of two percent, without resorting to counterfactual considerations, such as full nominal price indexation.[9]</p>\n<p>\\\nThe analysis here yields deep econometric implications. Firstly, the structural model and the demand shocks are identified with a standard policy rule under the null hypothesis that the model is correct.[10] This remedies a fundamental inconsistency in the existing framework. Additional persistence and a degree of symmetry in the coefficients should improve small sample properties.</p>\n<p>\\\nExisting work is biased. Under the null hypothesis that the model is correct, there is Econometric Duality; an equivalence between constraints on the re-optimization of the representative firm and statistical restrictions on the econometrician seeking to fit the Phillips curve model to the data. Stochastic equilibrium offers new sources of identification. This new theory promises new challenges with a tighter link between macroeconomic modelling and econometric theory.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe paper carries powerful results for all aspects of the Lucas Jr [1976] critique. On the one hand, the original equivalence result is wrong. Keynesian models contain lagged variables reflecting staggered optimization that the neoclassical framework does not. On the other hand, the notion of a trade-off where monetary activism causes an adverse movement in the Phillips curve schedule is borne out by the analysis of the coefficients. In fact, I show that the benchmark price Phillips curve is spurious in the sense that its slope is zero at a standard parametization and can be negative, which fits the message of his paper. The problem lies with the transmission mechanism which is entirely inter-temporal.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis is the essence of Output Neutrality. Where inter-temporal forces fall away, current inflation- as determined by optimal pricing- depends only on past and present pricing incentives, reflected in the lag and the expectation of the lead of inflation. Indeed, down this limit, inflation equals a half its lag and a half its future. These features agree with Taylor pricing, where inflation is determined by a weighted average of its lagged and future values, also with equal weight on past and future inflation. Consistent with output neutrality, the coefficients on marginal costs (or the output gap) sum to zero, as under Calvo. This creates a sturdy bridge between microeconomics and macroeconomics, as well as clear commonality between alternative models.</p>\n<p>\\\nFurthermore, the focus on mapping between micro and macroeconomic behavior returns to the fore in the guise of the a priori bifurcation analysis. This implies that the previous framework was not truly reflecting its underlying microfoundations, reflected in the re-optimization constraints. Finally, we can see the instances of non-existence through this lens, as they imply non-trivial barriers between microeconomic and macroeconomic inference.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe demise of Divine Coincidence brings wide-ranging benefits. It breaks the previous reliance on unintuitive mark-up shocks to shift the Phillips curve (see Le et al. [2011] and Fratto and Uhlig [2020]). These shocks are widely dismissed as credible explanations for inflationary bursts by surveys of leading economists (see Vaitilingum [25 February, 2022]), along with the natural policy prescription price controls.[11] It will allow macroeconomists to avoid invoking an Effective Lower Bound (ELB) on nominal interest rates to generate policy trade-offs. This is particularly relevant following recent increases in interest rates in major economies. It chimes with empirical evidence that ELB was not important in the last decade because Quantitative Easing (QE) seemed to mimic interest rate cuts, structural macroeconomic relationships appeared stable and deflation was missing particularly in the UK,[12] (see for example Wu and Xia [2016], Dahlhaus et al. [2018], Kuttner [2018], Dell’Ariccia et al. [2018], Wu [2018], Matousek et al. [2019], Di Maggio et al. [2020] and Weale and Wieladek [2022] (QE); Auerbach and Gorodnichenko [2017], Garín et al. [2019], Debortoli et al. [2019] and Mertens and Williams [2021] (structural).[13] Central Bank independence has surely been one of the most successful policy experiments in economic history (see for instance Alesina and Summers [1993], Cukierman et al. [1993], Bernanke et al. [1999] Acemoglu et al. [2008], Balls and Stansbury [1 May, 2017], and Garriga and Rodriguez [2020]). It is high time an intuitive benchmark model were provided to guide day-to-day deliberations. The solution here is a first step in this regard, although more work is needed to understand the effect of supply shocks.</p>\n<p>\\\nFinally, there are significant implications of the possibility for inactive policy. From a microeconomic point of view it can be seen as indicating stability of general equilibrium without aggregate shocks, against the rigidity of individual prices. This might help explain why policymakers have traditionally been unconcerned by microeconomic shocks.</p>\n<p>\\\nOn the macroeconomic ledger it has implications for both current and historical policy regimes. Macroeconomists often see stabilization through the prism of the Taylor principle- which states that inflation is controlled by raising the real interest rate in response to deviations of inflation from equilibrium. The policy rule derived here implies that it is not possible to immediately adjust interest rates to control inflation. This necessitates gradual changes of policy stance. This is in keeping with Central Bank best practice so-called \"coarse-tuning\" (Lindbeck [1992]). It is usually implemented via Inflation Forecast-Targeting (Kohn [2009], Svensson [2010] and Svensson [2012]). This is where policy and projections for future policy are adjusted to yield a desirable expected path for inflation and real activity, consistent with medium term stability. This is usually defined as forecast inflation and output gap sufficiently close to target after a time frame of 18 months to 3 years.[14]</p>\n<p>\\\nLastly, the policy result is of significance to our understanding of economic history. It helps to rationalize the survival of non-interventionist regimes like the Gold Standard where the \"Rules of the Game\" forbade active stabilization policy (see Barsky and Summers [1988], Bayoumi et al. [1997] and Bordo and Schwartz [2009]). Secondly, it should make it easier to analyze hypotheses like secular stagnation (Hansen [1939] and Summers [2015]) which require longlasting liquidity traps not possible in the existing representative agent setup. Lastly, it should support credible quantitative assessment of the benefits of modern macroeconomic management.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe subsequent section gives a more detailed description of the proof techniques suitable for a technical audience. It also sets the paper within the mathematical literature. Although, designed to be accessible, it could be skipped by less mathematically inclined readers.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Author:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) David Staines.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.16214.pdf\">available on arxiv</a> under CC 4.0 license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>[1] This is also true of online prices, (see Cavallo and Rigobon [2016], Cavallo [2017], Gorodnichenko and Talavera [2017], Gorodnichenko et al. [2018] and Cavallo [2018]).</p>\n<p>\\\n[2] The term is frequently attributed to Walter Heller, Chief Economic Adviser to President Kennedy (see for example http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/referenceentries/40422478/fine-tuning-1960s-economics). It referred originally to fiscal policy in an \"Old Keynesian\" setup. Scepticism about the concept was focal to monetarist opposition to traditional Keynesian macroeconomics, see for example Friedman [1968] and Snowdon and Vane [2005].</p>\n<p>\\\n[3] On the inter-temporal substitution front there is substantial support for an inter-temporal aggregate demand equation in both subjective beliefs and revealed preferences (see Coibion et al. [2023], Dräger and Nghiem [2021], Duca-Radu et al. [2021]), as well as discussion of previous microeconometric evidence in Appendix H.1.</p>\n<p>\\\n[4] None of the specifications are directly comparable to the theoretical model, which underlines the importance of structural estimation, although, Fuhrer [2006] is the closest. Many use unemployment rather than the output gap as a forcing variable. This has an august pedigree going back to Phillips [1958] and Phelps [1968]. It is popular since there is better data. The two can be connected via Okun’s law- the business cycle relationship between unemployment and output deviations, which appears empirically strong (Ball et al. [2013]). Nevertheless, it remains a priority to derive and test micro-founded wage Phillips curves.</p>\n<p>\\\n[5] Many of these studies are able to demonstrate stable relationships over recent times, despite structural change and the effects of the recent financial crisis (see also Stock and Watson [2020] and Candia et al. [2021]). Substantial inflation persistence is robust to different levels of aggregation, policy regime and plausible assumptions about trends in other macroeconomic variables, for evidence consult for example Clark [2006], Altissimo et al. [2009], Vaona and Ascari [2012]; O’Reilly and Whelan [2005], Beechey and Österholm [2012], Gerlach and Tillmann [2012]; Cogley and Sargent [2002], Stock and Watson [2016] and Kejriwal [2020].</p>\n<p>\\\n[6] Results of most applied interest have concerned the Krusell and Smith [1998] benchmark model of capital accumulation under incomplete markets and aggregate risk, such as Cao [2020] and Pröhl [2023]. However, these contain a degree of contingency (and are therefore not full existence proofs).</p>\n<p>\\\n[7] A literature on monotone comparative statics has developed around Milgrom and Roberts [1994], Milgrom and Shannon [1994], Milgrom and Segal [2002] and Athey [2002]. More recently, convexity conditions have been popular following Acemoglu and Jensen [2013] and Jensen [2018]. In fact, once the stochastic equilibrium has been derived the subsequent steps are often considerably easier than these results or recent extensions, with the promises of applications to a wider set of models.</p>\n<p>\\\n[8] Consult Kennedy [2003] for insightful discussion, and Hamilton [1995] for technical exposition. Granger and Newbold [1974] and Phillips [1986] are prominent original papers.</p>\n<p>\\\n[9]  It is in fact possible to remove the impact of price dispersion on the dynamics of marginal costs by assuming that labor is firm-specific (see Coibion and Gorodnichenko [2008] and Eggertsson and Singh [2019]). I find this result useful for theoretical expositions, although not fully convincing. It does not however, remedy the economic distortion on consumer welfare. Moreover, nominal dispersion would naturally return if wage rigidity were included in a Calvo fashion. Finally, utilities, unionized or minimum wage labor and general purpose technologies like IT, transport, logistics and office infrastructure surely imply a sizeable common component of firms’ cost base.</p>\n<p>\\\n[10] This is because under the null the rational expectations model is white noise so there are no valid instruments. Subjective expectations data solve this problem.</p>\n<p>\\\n[11] The article and the actual answers are available at the following addresses: https://voxeu.org/article/inflation-market-power-and-price-controls-igm-forum-survey https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/inflation-market-power-and-price-controls/ Aparicio and Cavallo [2021] analyze a set of price controls on Argentinian supermarkets and find that they had a limited effect on inflation that was reversed once they were removed.</p>\n<p>\\\n[12] The Fisherian channel where deflation drives up the real interest rate has been missing in the recent low interest rate spell. The extreme example of this lack of deflation phenomenon is the United Kingdom. From February 2009, just before the Bank cut its headline rate to a then record low of 0.5% to July 2018, immediately before the next time the base rate exceeded this level, the Consumer Price Index grew at an average annual of 2.55% in excess of the 2% mandated target. Data for price levels and policy changes are available from the sites below, results are robust to plausible changes of dating https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/timeseries/d7bt/mm23 https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/boeapps/database/Bank-Rate.asp</p>\n<p>\\\n[13] Any friction could in principle break Divine Coincidence, Blanchard and Galí [2007] use real wage rigidity. It is not clear whether Central Banks are concerned or able to correct real market failures over and above their stabilization objectives. It is debatable whether these alternative frictions are really first order at business cycle frequency. The best candidate is financial frictions. This has been a particular focus since the Great Recession. However, this recent interest has been accompanied by alternative instruments (see Clement [2010], Hanson et al. [2011], Duncan and Nolan [2015], Aikman et al. [2019] and Kashyap [2020]). Financial concerns were not a significant in monetary policymaking at major Central Banks previously, according to Baxa et al. [2013], Rotemberg [2013], Rotemberg [2015] and Oet and Lyytinen [2017]. In fact, financial shocks do not seem to be very important outside of crisis times, where they seem to operate like standard demand shocks (see Mian and Sufi [2014], Muir [2017], Mian and Sufi [2018], Huber [2018], Gertler and Gilchrist [2018], Benguria and Taylor [2020] and Haque and Magnusson [2021]).</p>\n<p>\\\n[14] Time series methods and policymakers’ wisdom suggest that it takes between 18 months and two years for a change in monetary policy to have its maximum impact on inflation. This result seems to be robust across changes in policy regimes according to Bernanke et al. [1999] (see p 315-320), Batini and Nelson [2001], Gerlach and Svensson [2003] and recent analysis by Goodhart and Pradhan [2023]. On its website the Bank of England advises the general public that: \"Monetary policy operates with a time lag of about two years.\" (http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/Pages/overview.aspx) However, the Bank publishes forecasts three years ahead and frequently talks about \"inflation returning to target by the three year horizon\" consistent with a longer view of the stabilization and empirical work by Havranek and Rusnak [2013]. (http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/inflationreport/infrep.aspx) Practices are similar at other leading inflation targeting Central Banks.</p>",

Trend Inflation Volatility</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"2mathematicalarguments\">2 Mathematical Arguments</h2>\n<p>This paper has two mathematical objectives, one analytic the other algebraic. The first is to analyze the most basic qualitative and quantitative properties governing existence of equilibrium. The second to describe the algebraic structures around ZINSS that give rise to the erroneous conclusions holding back modern macroeconomics. The subsequent discussion is heuristic rather than technically precise.[15]</p>\n<p>\\\nThe central analytic contribution is a powerful fixed-point result. In fact, Theorem 3 provides necessary and sufficient conditions for any solution to exist, in a wide class of DSGE models, for a popular limiting case. Away from this limit, the condition is a requirement for standard statistical inference.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe proof has two parts. The first step uses an argument from the Markov chains literature to show that the model has to mix. This follows easily from two standard features of these models: firstly, the existence of a sufficiently smooth cocycle in the mathematical expectation (coming from rational expectations) and secondly, the blow up on the boundary of the relevant objective functions of the optimizing agents, along a popular limit.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe second step is motivated by control theory of linear rational expectations systems. It employs the local regularity properties from a stochastic Grobman-Hartman theorem of Coayla-Teran et al. [2007] to prove that only a unique stable solution is consistent with equilibrium existence. This arises where the number of eigenvalues inside the unit circle matches the number of jump variables and the number outside the total predetermined variables. Standard calculations yield functional conditions containing non-linear functions evaluated at the ergodic invariant measure.</p>\n<p>\\\nApplications follow swiftly. Theorem 4 uses basic ergodic theory to demonstrate that the probabilistic trajectory of the mean field system is unique, overturning previous non-rigorous work. The main focus of the paper is on limits where the noise is small. This allows me to derive quantitative estimates of the structural parameters supporting equilibrium existence using elementary methods. Polydromy arises because one variable, which is second order around the non-stochastic steady state, is first order around the stochastic steady state, although existence conditions are unaffected.</p>\n<p>\\\nFor future functional analysis, I provide a mathematical rigidity result stemming from ergodicity. The comparative statics in Theorem 2 can also be interpreted in this light as (sharp) a priori quantitative moment estimates, reflecting model-specific equilibrium restrictions. They could surely be profitably combined in future to yield quantitative descriptions of the function space supporting this and other DSGE. Moreover, in Theorem 8, I prove a basic regularity result pertaining to the optimal policy problem that should be more amenable to existing functional analysis goals and techniques.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe De Rham cohomology underpins the bifurcation analysis. In Decomposition 1, I calculate the singular surface around ZINSS. Theorem 6 and extensions connect the structure of the singular surface to the efficiency properties of ZINSS and the absence of distortions from large shocks. The disproof of Divine Coincidence, in Theorem 8, confirms the constraints interpretation.</p>\n<p>\\\nMore abstract techniques including schemes and categories help to generalize and interpret these bifurcations. In Theorem 7, scheme theory is used to show that cross-equation cancellations are the ultimate source of all bifurcations in DSGE systems (with well-defined solutions) and admits speedy generalization. Furthermore, the idea of \"near solutions\", constructed via scheme theory, allow me to formalize Stochastic Bifurcation and to explain how the effect attributed to trend inflation conceals an error in the Phillips curve approximated at ZINSS. Econometric duality results from the confluence of constrained optimization, scheme and cohomology theory. Finally, categories allow me to axiomize an aspect of the Lucas critique.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe paper contributes to two strands of mathematical and statistical literature. The first concerns mean field games. These are a joint endeavour between mathematics, economics, engineering and other disciplines. Some prominent papers include Jovanovic and Rosenthal [1988], Caines et al. [2006], Lasry and Lions [2006], Lasry and Lions [2007a], Guéant et al. [2011] and Cardaliaguet et al. [2019].</p>\n<p>\\\nThe closest to macroeconomics include Lasry and Lions [2007b], Nourian and Caines [2013], Bensoussan et al. [2016], Lasry and Lions [2018] and Cardaliaguet et al. [2020] that consider games with small and large players. Macroeconomic applications, so far, include Achdou et al. [2022] who construct a mean field solution to an incomplete markets model and Porretta and Rossi [2022] who study economic growth in the context of knowledge diffusion. Lastly, Alvarez et al. [2023] focus on a restricted variant of the Calvo model studied here.[16] [17]</p>\n<p>\\\nResults in adjacent areas include Carmona et al. [2016], Lacker [2016] and Carmona and Delarue [2018], who study common noise (aggregate shocks) but in finite time or with restrictive monotonicity conditions, as in Bertucci et al. [2021].[18] Gomes et al. [2010], Chau et al. [2017], Saldi et al. [2018a], Saldi et al. [2018b] and Saldi [2019] are formulated in discrete time. Finally, Cardaliaguet and Souganidis [2022] attack a (representative agent) model with no idiosyncratic noise.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe closest contributions to my own concern ergodicity and non-existence. In ergodic mean field games, players maximize a long-term average objective function. Cao et al. [2022] show that discounted mean field games approach their ergodic counterpart as time preference recedes. This parallels my focus on stochastic equilibrium here. Secondly, Cirant and Ghilli [2022] prove a nonexistence result. The culprit is a strong complementarity (externality), in their case, it is effectively in the economy’s growth process. Decomposition 2 has this flavour here, albeit with a different source. With direct macroeconomic application, Alvarez et al. [2023] uncovers non-existence, when strategic complementarities in pricing cross a critical threshold. Both results focus on the limit of finite time, with a boundary condition designed to represent long-run equilibrium, rather than a true infinite horizon with an endogenous destination.</p>\n<p>\\\nA unique feature of my approach is an emphasis on game-theoretic constructive methods. The limiting construct is inspired by the folk theorem and the eigenvalue condition functions like a dynamic incentive compatibility constraint for the entire economy. This paper constitutes the first progress on constructing rigorous solutions to a general class of mean field games with common noise over infinite time- which is surely the major open problem of the whole literature (Achdou et al. [2014]).</p>\n<p>\\\nThis paper is formulated in discrete time, partly to reduce the technical burden on readers. Nevertheless, I am confident that techniques and concepts will carry over into continuous time, under some circumstances. An example, discussed in Section 6, shows that there may be differences in qualitative behavior between discrete and continuous time. It should be possible to analyze this time-scaling behavior, both to help economists decide which solutions to use and for its mathematical beauty.</p>\n<p>\\\nBoth the a priori duality result and the ex post blow ups are connected to a small literature on phase transition of test statistics, which studies conditions where statistical estimators cease to converge. Examples include Cover [1965], Silvapulle [1981], Albert and Anderson [1984], Santner and Duffy [1986], Sur et al. [2019], Candès and Sur [2020] and McCracken [2020]. I am confident statistical theory will expand along many frontiers to accommodate the deep and multi-faceted predictions of stochastic equilibrium theory.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn my epsilon management I will deploy the asymptotic notation x &lt;&lt; y to mean \"x is negligible relative to y\".[19] Unless otherwise stated, all background results are available in Aliprantis and Border [2007] or Royden and Fitzpatrick [2010]. Jacobson [2009] and Jacobson [1980] might be helpful references for the abstract algebra with Eisenbud and Harris [2006] useful for schemes. The main text will emphasize intuition with more formality and some preliminaries in the Appendices.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Author:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) David Staines.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.16214.pdf\">available on arxiv</a> under CC 4.0 license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>[15] It is helpful to define a few terms from mathematical analysis for the benefit of economists. A quantitative estimate is where an unknown function or constant is bounded using only the model’s primitives. Mathematical rigidity is where a collection of objects can be described from a smaller set of their properties. Universality is where models with different formulations display common behavior or structures. They will appear repeatedly in this section.</p>\n<p>\\\n[16] They use the price gap formulation of the period profit function (Woodford [2009]), which avoids the singularities in the existing approximation, at the expense of simplifying dynamics.</p>\n<p>\\\n[17] Bilal [2023] develops perturbation techniques using the master equation but does not prove existence results. His focus on reflecting boundaries suits his main application to job ladders and unemployment but contrasts with the blow-up condition here.</p>\n<p>\\\n[18] Monotonicity conditions are popular in the mean field game literature but are restrictive because macroeconomic time series typically display non-monotone responses particularly when there are shocks to monetary policy.</p>\n<p>\\\n[19] This corresponds to x = o(y) in the notation of Tao [April 2, 2012], where further background can be found.</p>",

Trend Inflation Volatility</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"3outlineandpreview\">3 Outline and Preview</h2>\n<p>This final introductory section has two parts: the first summarizes the Phillips curve argument, whilst the second sets out the structure of the rest of the paper.</p>\n<h3 id=\"31phillipscurve\">3.1 Phillips Curve</h3>\n<p>A typical textbook New Keynesian Phillips curve currently looks like this</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-sd83zhj.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThe reason why is that as we approach ZINSS the Phillips curve is punctured by the following system of three singularities.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-mc93zsr.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThe first is the wall of the crossing, which is necessary to the bifurcation. The second is a statistical restriction that destroys the error term. The third reflects the inter-temporal substitution incentive of the resetting firms. The crucial point is that substituting the singularities into the correct Phillips curve (2) simplifies to yield (1) the incorrect counterpart. The nature of the wall-crossing is that it is not possible to move in the other direction. This explains where macroeconomists went wrong for so many years.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe precise parametric form of all coefficients are detailed later in the paper. The output gap term vanishing is specific to the parametization choices, which is discussed in the Appendix H alongside robustness exercises. The only nonstandard selection was a lower value for the inflation response, in the policy rule, in line with the anti-Taylor principle.</p>\n<h3 id=\"32roadmap\">3.2 Roadmap</h3>\n<p>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 4 sets out the New Keynesian framework. Section 5 focuses on existing solutions and details the Lucas critique. Section 6 lays out the stochastic equilibrium and a priori results. Section 7 derives the general Phillips curve. Section 8 proves the theoretical conditions governing existence and non-existence of equilibrium. Section 9 rigorously develops the bifurcation theory. Section 10 covers theoretical and econometric implications. Section 11 is devoted to the policy rule. Section 12 is for discussion.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Author:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) David Staines.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.16214.pdf\">available on arxiv</a> under CC 4.0 license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>",

The assumptions concerning error terms present throughout the paper are discussed. The section winds up with a crucial finite dimensional characterization of the system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"41householdsproblem\">4.1 Household’s Problem</h3>\n<p>This part lays out the households optimization problem that underpins the demand side of the economy. There is a single representative household[20] that chooses consumption <em>C</em> and labor supply <em>L</em>, so as to maximize the following objective function</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-lm83zn4.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nsubject to the budget constraint</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-lw93zys.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThere is a unit continuum of firms. Π(<em>i</em>) is profit from an individual firm <em>i</em> given by</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-bba3zay.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nNote in a stochastic environment firms need not make the same profits even with a symmetric equilibrium. Since when price rigidity is introduced, firms with the same demand curve will charge different prices, depending on when they last re-optimized and can therefore make different levels of profit.[21] The budget constraint states that the uses for nominal income (consumption and saving) must be equal to the sources of income (wealth, labor and dividend income).</p>\n<p>\\\nFinally, there are two constraints</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-5pb3zbc.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-51c3zr2.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThe first is a bond market clearing condition. It is simplification designed to allow me to ignore the effect of government spending or debt management. It is not important at this stage because the analysis focuses on limiting cases where, without nominal frictions, Ricardian equivalence ensures that debt levels do not matter (Barro [1974]). The second is a transversality condition. It is necessary for a well-defined optimization problem. It forces the household to honor their debts. Otherwise they would seek to borrow an unbounded amount and never repay. Giglio et al. [2016] provides model-independent support.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Author:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) David Staines.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.16214.pdf\">available on arxiv</a> under CC 4.0 license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>[20] You may be surprised with a model where the world is organized into one happy family. It simplifies the dynamic exposition. Werning [2016] provides useful aggregation results, however none survive a full stochastic setting. The bifurcation analysis, the backbone of the Phillips curve, goes through without reference to a specific Euler.</p>\n<p>\\\n[21] In fact non-resetters need not have positive profit expectations or even a non-negative stock price, although, I will show this does not apply in our quantitative setting. Alternatively, one could swerve around this problem by imagining there are a continuum of households who each own one firm and an efficient long-term insurance market with contracts set arbitrarily far back in the past (so that there is no conditioning on pricing history). In this case the market will absorb all idiosyncratic risk associated with non-optimal price setting behavior.</p>",

Re-optimization is governed by a stochastic process common across firms. With probability 1 − α each firm is free to reset its price (at no cost), whilst with probability α it keeps its price fixed and meets demand at its existing price. Firms reset their prices to maximize the expected present value of profits through the lifetime of the price as follows:</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-hz83za7.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nsubject to the individual demand (17).

The second is a local condition that justifies the √ ε limiting construction. Neither result is novel so proofs are relegated to Appendix B.3. The intuition is that consumers prefer variety and it is therefore costly to substitute between high and low price goods. Therefore they cannot achieve the same utility when prices are dispersed which will always arise when prices are rigid and inflation variable. Here with Calvo pricing, ∆ evolves according to the following relationship:</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-5ia3z9e.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nUsing Proposition 1, I can solve for the reset price to give a recursion in inflation</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-wcb3zl9.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nFinally, there is the monetary policy rule.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-vmc3zfm.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nWhen selecting such a simple rule, my key concerns were tractability and comparability with previous work. In the next part, I confirm that including lags or leads would not be justified by welfare concerns in a purely forward-looking model. This fits with my ultimate goal of justifying inertial policy from an optimal policy standpoint. My policy analysis should prove immune to timing issues and information available to the Central Bank. This is because the boundary case of inactivity is common to all possible policy rules, whilst in a persistent stochastic setting even the expectations of future variables would induce inertia.[26]</p>\n<p>\\\n26Taylor’s actual proposal was somewhat closer to my analysis. His rule used an inflation measure averaged over the previous four quarters. Although, his motivation was different, he envisaged that the lagged inflation rate would serve as a proxy for expected inflation. In the same conference (Henderson and McKibbin [1993]) came up with a very similar formulation.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-9md3zct.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Author:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) David Staines.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.16214.pdf\">available on arxiv</a> under CC 4.0 license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<p>\\</p>",

It is not possible to find a closed form but I am able to find a recursive form by inverting expressions for the recursive term ℵ. It reveals that economic dynamics are generically persistent.

There is a natural focus on the first order approximation, although I am able to generalize salient results to non-linear solutions. I set out familiar problems with their predictions concerning persistence and optimal policy.</p>\n<p>\\\nNext, I set out two alternative models of nominal rigidity the Lucas and Rotemberg Phillips curves. Up to parametric conditions, I connect these three models in a pseudo-observational equivalence, which I later disprove. This allows me to link this wrong claim back to a particular argument in Lucas Jr [1976].

Trend Inflation Volatility</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"51singularphillipscurve\">5.1 Singular Phillips Curve</h2>\n<p>This subsection flags up the subtle error in the standard approximation that brings about a purely forward-looking solution. Linearizing the two components of the Phillips curve at ZINSS reveals a special structure, in particular, there is a common root L = 1/αβ in both lag polynomials.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-do83zvo.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThis means the system can be solved by elimination. Therefore, we do not have to lag one of the recursions to perform a substitution introducing lagged terms. The next result confirms that this is unrepresentative of the dynamics of any stochastic system because it only applies when inflation is at steady state where the approximation is irrelevant. Let Lℵ equal the zero of the lag polynomial in ℵ.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-y093zp9.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>Proof</em>.

Trend Inflation Volatility</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"52persistenceandpolicypuzzles\">5.2 Persistence and Policy Puzzles</h2>\n<p>This subsection begins with observations concerning the stochastic properties or lack thereof of the Phillips curve. I lay out Divine Coincidence. When I add suitable error terms, I am able to extend these results to rule out persistence. Moreover, under a different plausible timing condition there can be no meaningful policy change so optimal policy implements laissez-faire. The second subsection shows that these properties extend to non-linear approximations either directly or under a suitable special case.</p>\n<h3 id=\"521linearization\">5.2.1 Linearization</h3>\n<p><strong>Remark 4.</strong> <em>The New Keynesian Phillips curve (53) and (54) is stochastically singular. It cannot be statistically estimated without an additional non-structural disturbance i.e. unrelated to model primitives. This justifies the criticism of \"dubious structural shocks\" by Chari et al. [2009] in particular the role ascribed to mark-up shocks in the Phillips curves of leading New Keynesian models based on the current linearization.</em></p>\n<p>\\\nIts proof, contained in Appendix C.1.2, is a modification of Theorem 5.5 in Acemoglu [2009]. It features the infinite horizon budget constraint, from which some additional economic intuition is garnered. The result intrinsically concerns linear approximations, trade-offs will arise through price dispersion in the non-linear setting.</p>\n<p>\\\nSubsequent results set out related problems with policy and persistence that will extend to alternative models with similar properties to the bifurcated Calvo model. Turning to the Phillips curve, to derive econometric interpretations it is necessary to add non-structural errors. The preferred interpretation is that this represents an expectation error. Future work should explore the distinct role and implications of structured and unstructured features of error terms.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-y883zhv.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nUnexplained serial correlation in econometrics is an indication of misspecification, as discussed in Kennedy [2003]. This principle has underpinned empirical investigations of the Phillips curve, such as Galı and Gertler [1999] and others discussed in Mavroeidis et al. [2014].[30] The lack of viable persistence sources can have stark implications.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-b493zaf.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThe system is not statistically identified for lack of valid instruments. Intuitively, when there is no persistence there is no way of instrumenting for future expectations, in particular for inflation. It should not be surprising that attempts to do so have been an empirical failure. This result implies that these estimates are in a strict sense ill-defined with respect to the underlying theory. The current model of the Phillips curve is not fit for policy purposes, where theory consistent econometric investigation is paramount.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Remark 5.</strong> <em>Determinacy would become existence conditions if one were to interpret the bifurcated model as an approximation of a non-linear model based on its singular surface.</em></p>\n<p>\\\nThe final two results here concern policymaking. The first originated with Woodford [2001].</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-oza3z8g.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThis familiar result states that monetary policymakers must \"lean against the wind\" sufficiently or they would lose control of inflation expectations. It is a figment of an entirely forward-looking model. The final result extends the Divine Coincidence idea to a stochastic environment. Its proof, similar to Proposition 8 is omitted.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-9eb3zpl.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nIf there is no (ad hoc) backward-looking component to the objective function and the Central Bank is interested in stabilizing the economy, it never changes the interest rate, in response to business cycle conditions. This justifies my decision to neglect backward-looking terms in the policy function. It should only respond to financial market conditions and long-run equilibrium movements. These were arguably features present in the Classical Gold Standard, as argued in Bayoumi et al. [1997]. Indeed, they could work automatically through financial market equilibrium forces.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis \"do nothing\" policy has a long tradition in classical and monetarist economics, (consult Friedman [1960], De Long [2000] and Chari et al. [2009]). However, it is not Keynesian and does not reflect modern policy setting anywhere with an inflation targeting framework. The persistence I derive will give a rationale for active monetary policy. The nature of optimal policy will be left for future work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"522nonlinearapproximations\">5.2.2 Non-Linear Approximations</h3>\n<p>It is become more feasible and increasingly common for economists to use nonlinear techniques, such as higher order approximations in their work. It is important to know that my conclusions are not a figment of the linearization. The first result shows that all but the most extreme of the previous results applies to a refined version of the non-linear model. Firm-specific labor supply is a popular simplifying assumption that allows us to divorce price dispersion from the optimizing decisions of the firm. It is isomorphic to setting ∆ = 1. It would show up elsewhere in the optimizing problem but we will ignore this as Divine Coincidence is a linear phenomenon.[31]</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-idc3zbu.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>Proof.</em> The proof consists of simply expanding out the non-linear Phillips curve without loss of generality. I can work with analytic functions (since they are dense in a standard function space)[32] Proceed once more by subtracting (41) from (42). Focus first on the bank of terms in ψt and MCt and use the labor supply curve formed from (19) and (38). However, it is no longer stochastically singular.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-kod3zkk.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThe central points are that σ = 1 rules out output terms not entering through marginal costs, whilst cross-product terms remove stochastic singularity. The second bank of terms is</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-fee3z8i.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Author:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) David Staines.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.16214.pdf\">available on arxiv</a> under CC 4.0 license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>[29] This formulation is a weak form of the rational expectations hypothesis, as opposed to the strict form where the individuals fully understand the structural model which here would take us back to stochastic singularity.</p>\n<p>\\\n[30] Similar sentiments and goals appear in Rotemberg and Woodford [1996] and Nakamura and Steinsson [2010] among others.</p>\n<p>\\\n[31] Alternatively we could imagine an ad hoc demand system which will be shown in the next subsection.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-gi83zro.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n[33] These high order approximations are not the focus here but in application terms in ψ and A would be normalized. Technology shocks can enter first order dynamics if there is uncertainty or disagreement about the output gap measure. However, this persistence does not carry over to inflation response to a demand shock (see C.2.2).</p>",

They will be used in the next section and throughout the paper as a point of comparison with solutions of the Calvo model. The first model is classical, in the sense that it features perfectly flexible prices. The second is Keynesian because prices are not able to adjust fully to inflation. Along with the menu cost model discussed in Section 8, it is an example of a state-dependent pricing model. Crucially, it does not feature staggered optimization. Prices will typically change in every period. I layout the equivalence between the existing solution of Calvo and the Rotemberg model, I extend this equivalence to the original Lucas model, allowing me to view it as part of the observational equivalence claim of Lucas Jr [1976]. Finally, I briefly review the rest of the critique.</p>\n<h3 id=\"531lucasmodel\">5.3.1 Lucas Model</h3>\n<p>Lucas Jr [1972] is the original rational expectations monetary model. Markets are perfectly competitive and anticipated monetary shocks are impotent. Monetary non-neutrality arises because of imperfect information rather than sticky prices. Nevertheless, by adding a money demand function, I am able to derive surprising similarity to New Keynesian models with price rigidity.</p>\n<p>\\\nThere are a collection of price-taking households.[34] Each produces a single good, using just its own labor.[35] The choice problem simplifies to a static labor-leisure trade-of</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-sb93z36.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThe first order condition balances marginal revenue and marginal cost so</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-wda3z04.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nSolving and log-linearizing gives an expression for an individual firm’s supply curve</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-x3b3zwg.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nFor parsimony, a reduced form aggregate demand curve replaces the Euler equation (18).</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-udc3zbk.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n\\\nIdiosyncratic taste shocks, reflected by the disturbance zt(i) in the individual firms demand schedule, are essential to the Lucas model. I assume they are independent and identically distributed across producers and time, with tail restrictions such that they will cancel out in aggregate almost surely. Here is the log-linear form</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-vsd3zxm.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThere is linear aggregation so</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-3ie3zmx.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nwhilst</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-spf3zdd.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nMonetary non-neutrality is entirely driven by unexpected shocks. There is no role for price dispersion here, since the firms are price-takers and the distribution of relative price is unaffected by inflation. Unlike its Keynesian counterparts, the Lucas model would be unaffected by trend inflation.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-ywh3zwf.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nUsing the individual supply curve (62), demand curve (64), steady state deviation (68) and the Lucas supply curve, (71) and (72) implies the expression for relative price deviation</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-tdi3zdl.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nand from (69) and (70)</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-w8j3z98.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThis allows me to derive the following implicit formulation final form for the slope of the Lucas surprise Phillips curve</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-cgk3zig.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"532rotembergpricing\">5.3.2 Rotemberg Pricing</h3>\n<p>This model Rotemberg [1982] is perhaps the simplest formulation of state dependent pricing and the one most commonly compared to Calvo. The idea is that firms face a convex cost of changing prices and therefore they do not adjust immediately to their optimal flexible price. The problem is that convex costs of price changing imply firms change their prices every period through small adjustments. This runs contrary to an overwhelming body of evidence of infrequent large adjustment discussed in Appendix H.1.3.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-7al3zrs.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nTherefore the first order conditions simplify to</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-zsm3zfg.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nFinally, the resource constraint reflecting a wedge between production and consumption caused by the cost of price changing replaces (20)</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-36n3zx6.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>:::info\n<strong>Author:</strong></p>\n<p>(1) David Staines.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.16214.pdf\">available on arxiv</a> under CC 4.0 license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>[34] It is not common to have differentiated products and price-taking behavior. For motivation imagine there were actually multiple households producing the same good and therefore competition between them or the possibility to set-up firms with a consequent free entry condition. Recall the Bertrand paradox that two competing firms can implement a competitive equilibrium.</p>\n<p>\\\n[35] This formulation comes from Romer [2012]. The idea is to avoid the households using the economy-wide labor market to deduce the aggregate price level. In the original paper, Lucas used an overlapping generations structure where households produced in one period then sold output in the next. Recent literature has developed more sophisticated stories about dispersed private information and strategic interaction. I do not pursue this approach as I am looking for a benchmark model.</p>",

      "content": "Nuclear rods are traditionally clad in metal. But a U.S. energy company wants to develop a better, safer alternative that instead uses silicon carbide composites. Working with America's Energy Department, General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems just completed a 120-day irradiation testing period simulating the intense radiation and extreme temperatures (3,452F) of a pressurized water reactor in a real-world nuclear power plant. \n\nAnd the tests \"showed no significant mass change, indicating promising performance,\" the company said in a statement. \"This indicates that the SiGA cladding is exceptionally resistant to the damaging effects of radiation.\"\n\nLong-time Slashdot reader fahrbot-bot shared this report from the Interesting Engineering blog:\n\n\"This success is a key milestone on SiGA cladding's development path to enhance the safety of the existing U.S. fleet of light water reactors,\" added Scott Forney, president of GA-EMS. \"It could also do the same for the future generation of advanced nuclear power systems.\" This advanced material offers significant advantages over traditional metal cladding. It can withstand temperatures up to 1900 degreesC (3452 degreesF), far exceeding the limits of current materials. This enhanced heat resistance is crucial for improving safety margins in nuclear reactors. Moreover, the company claims that in case of any accident, SiGA cladding is designed to maintain its integrity at temperatures where traditional cladding might fail. This could prevent the release of radioactive materials and significantly improve overall reactor safety. \n\nFurthermore, SiGA cladding offers performance benefits. It enables higher power operation and longer fuel lifetimes. This translates to increased efficiency and reduced costs for nuclear power plants... \n\nThe design, safety, and installation of new nuclear reactors have been a prime subject for research. Recently, France-based Newcleo applied to the United Kingdom's Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) to enter its lead-cooled small modular reactor for generating fission energy in the generic design assessment phase. Newcleo's SMR can operate at atmospheric pressure, and the company also states that no significant energy release occurs in cases of vessel failure. This also eliminates the need for high-pressure-resistant containment.\n \nThe article notes that General Atomics's collaboration with the U.S. Energy Department is \"part of the Accident Tolerant Fuel Program, a national effort to improve the safety and performance of nuclear reactors.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=New+Nuclear+Fuel+Rods+Endure+3%2C452F+For+120-Day+Test%2C+Raising+Hopes+for+Safer+Reactors%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F06%2F2233231%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F06%2F2233231%2Fnew-nuclear-fuel-rods-endure-3452f-for-120-day-test-raising-hopes-for-safer-reactors%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/24/12/06/2233231/new-nuclear-fuel-rods-endure-3452f-for-120-day-test-raising-hopes-for-safer-reactors?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23544013&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

While the situation in Africa attests to varying rates of internet penetration, the lack of access to quality internet connection remains a major concern.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe result is a continent&nbsp;where internet service providers are exploitative and where governments have successively failed to invest in local infrastructure and diversification strategies at a time when the continent is at a crucial point in history marked by the emergence of cutting-edge digital technologies such as blockchain technology.</p>\n<h3 id=\"depinadigitalvisionforapeopleownedinfrastructure\">DePIN: A Digital Vision for a People-Owned Infrastructure</h3>\n<p>An innovative solution known as a decentralized physical infrastructure network ( DePIN), is pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology by breaking into critical sectors of society.</p>\n<p>\\\nDecentralized Physical Infrastructure is more than a technology trend, it's a bold move to reorient the world toward a decentralized ownership model of critical infrastructures such as transport, energy, cloud computing –and even the internet.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhat makes DePIN innovative is that it cuts across conventional methods and offers cost-effective solutions to every challenge leveraging blockchain technology and mobilizing people as an integral part of the solution.

Users on the network provide hotspots verified by the network's consensus mechanism, proof of coverage,&nbsp;and token rewards.</p>\n<p>\\\nRoam is another exciting example of a decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) innovation designed for a decentralized wireless network, with the potential to bridge Africa's internet pain points.</p>\n<p>\\\nThrough an innovation called OpenRoaming Wifi, it seeks to provide stable and uninterrupted internet connection, ideally suiting a continent like Africa where constant internet interruption is rife. This solution is rooted in the idea of being able to access a roaming internet connection from your location.</p>\n<p>\\\nIncentivizing over one million users on its decentralized platform involves providing free data credits based on interactive activities and milestones designed to keep them invested in the ecosystem in the long run.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Africa continues to grapple with poor internet connectivity, high costs, and poor infrastructure; its reliance on global internet infrastructure shows its high level of vulnerability to disruptions.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe struggle for quality internet access is real across the continent, impacting individuals and businesses alike.</p>\n<p>\\\nAt this time of significant technological advancements, DePIN is bringing about cost-effective solutions to the control and maintenance of critical public infrastructure like the Internet.

      "content": "\"The U.S. government on Friday ordered testing of the nation's milk supply for bird flu,\" reports the Associated Press, \"to better monitor the spread of the virus in dairy cows.\"\n\n\nRaw or unpasteurized milk from dairy farms and processors nationwide must be tested on request starting Dec. 16, the Agriculture Department said. Testing will begin in six states &mdash; California, Colorado, Michigan, Mississippi, Oregon and Pennsylvania. \nOfficials said the move is aimed at \"containing and ultimately eliminating the virus,\" known as Type A H5N1, which was detected for the first time in March in U.S. dairy cows. Since then, more than 700 herds have been confirmed to be infected in 15 states. \"This will give farms and farmworkers better confidence in the safety of their animals and ability to protect themselves, and it will put us on a path to quickly controlling and stopping the virus' spread nationwide,\" Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement. \n\nThe risk to people from bird flu remains low, health officials said. Pasteurization, or heat treatment, kills the virus in milk, leaving it safe to drink... At least 58 people in the U.S. have been infected with bird flu, mostly farm workers who became mildly ill after close contact with infected cows, including their milk, or infected poultry.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=US+Government+Orders+Nationwide+Testing+of+Milk+for+Bird+Flu+to+Stop+the+Virus's+Spread%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F06%2F2330232%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F06%2F2330232%2Fus-government-orders-nationwide-testing-of-milk-for-bird-flu-to-stop-the-viruss-spread%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/06/2330232/us-government-orders-nationwide-testing-of-milk-for-bird-flu-to-stop-the-viruss-spread?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23544059&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

      "content": "An anonymous reader shared this report from the blog Windows Central:\nMicrosoft has ended production on the Surface Studio 2+, its ultra-premium all-in-one desktop PC designed for creatives and commercial customers. Starting at a whopping $4,500, the Studio 2+ was the ultimate Windows all-in-one with the best touchscreen display on a unique hinge that allowed the screen to lay down like a draft board... So, if you're interested in buying a Surface Studio 2+, you better hurry, as whatever stock is remaining is all that's left. Unfortunately, it's likely that the end of production on the Surface Studio 2+ also marks an end to the Surface Studio line as a whole. My own sources tell me there's no Studio 2+ successor lined up currently. \n\nArs Technica points out that over the eight-year run of the Surface Studio, Microsoft only updated it twice.\n\n\nLike the Surface Laptop Studio, the desktop's claim to fame was a unique hinge design for its screen, which could reposition it to make it easier to draw on with the Surface Pen. But the desktop's high cost and its perennially outdated internal components made it a less appealing machine than it could have been... \n\nThe longest-lived Studio desktop was the Surface Studio 2, which was released in 2018 and wasn't replaced until a revised Surface Studio 2+ was announced in late 2022. It used an even higher-quality display panel, but it still used previous-generation internal components. This might not have been so egregious if Microsoft had updated it more consistently, but this model went untouched for so long that Microsoft had to lower Windows 11's system requirements specifically to cover the Studio 2 so that the company wouldn't be ending support for a PC that it was still actively selling. \n\nThe Studio 2+ was the desktop's last hurrah, and despite jumping two GPU generations and four CPU generations, it still didn't use the latest components available at the time. Again, more consistent updates like the ones Microsoft provides for the Surface Pro and Surface Laptop could have made this less of a problem, but the Studio 2+ once again sat untouched for two years after being updated.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Microsoft+Discontinues+Its+%244%2C500+All-in-One+Desktop%2C+'Surface+Studio'%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F07%2F0144230%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F07%2F0144230%2Fmicrosoft-discontinues-its-4500-all-in-one-desktop-surface-studio%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/24/12/07/0144230/microsoft-discontinues-its-4500-all-in-one-desktop-surface-studio?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23544141&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

      "content": "The Verge thinks Valve \"could make a play to dethrone the Sony PlayStation and Microsoft.\" And it's not just because there's lots of new SteamOS hardware on the way (including a wireless VR headset and a pair of trackable wands, a Steam Controller 2 gamepad, and a living room console. \n\n\"Valve has also now seemingly revealed plans for partners to create third-party SteamOS hardware too.\"\nIt won't be easy to take on Sony, Microsoft, or Meta. Those companies have a lot to lose, and they're deeply entrenched. But the Steam Deck has revealed a massive weakness in each of their businesses that may take them years to correct &mdash; the desire to play a huge library of games anytime, anywhere. And while they figure that out, Valve may be building an entire new ecosystem of SteamOS hardware, one that could finally let PC and peripheral makers tap into the huge and growing library of Windows games on all sorts of different hardware without relying on Microsoft or subjecting their customers to the many annoyances of Windows... \n\n\nValve has long said it will open up SteamOS to other manufacturers, even recently committing to some direct support for rival handhelds like the Asus ROG Ally &mdash; and the other week, Valve quietly updated a document that may reveal its larger overarching strategy. It won't just leave SteamOS sitting around and hope manufacturers build something &mdash; it'll hold their hand. Valve now has an explicit label for third parties to create \"Powered by SteamOS\" devices, which it explicitly defines as \"hardware running the SteamOS operating system, implemented in close collaboration with Valve.\" It additionally lets companies create \"Steam Compatible\" hardware that ships with \"Valve approved controller inputs,\" as well as SteamVR hardware and Steam Link hardware that lets you stream games from one device to another... \n\nWhen Valve asked PC manufacturers to sign onto its Steam Machines initiative over a decade ago, with the idea of building living room PC consoles, it asked for a leap of faith with very little to show and a tiny chance of success. It took years for Valve to even build the oddball living room controller for its Steam Machines, and it didn't get far in convincing Windows game developers to port their games to Linux. But by the time it announced the Steam Deck, Valve had hammered out a Proton software compatibility layer so good that many Windows games now run better on Linux, and created the most customizable yet familiar set of controls ever made. If manufacturers could build their own Steam Machines rather than equivalent Windows machines, they could offer better gaming products than they do today. Maybe they'd even want to release a VR headset that isn't tied to Microsoft or Meta if it doubled as a Steam Deck, portably playing decades of flatscreen games. \n\nIt's not clear any of this will pan out; Valve is an exceedingly small company that tries not to chase too many things at a time. When I speak to PC industry executives about why they pick Windows over SteamOS, some say they're concerned about whether Valve would truly be able to support them. But it's just as intriguing an idea as it was 12 years ago when Gabe Newell explained the initial vision to us, and this time, there's a far better chance it'll work. \n\n\"Today, every major PC company is building one or more Steam Deck rivals,\" the article points out. \"But without Valve's blessing and support, they're saddled with a Windows OS that doesn't start, pause, and resume games quickly and seamlessly enough to feel portable and easy...\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Is+Valve+Letting+Third+Parties+Create+SteamOS+Hardware%3F%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgames.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F07%2F0259225%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgames.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F07%2F0259225%2Fis-valve-letting-third-parties-create-steamos-hardware%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://games.slashdot.org/story/24/12/07/0259225/is-valve-letting-third-parties-create-steamos-hardware?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23544199&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

The film \"imagines a turn of the century where the machines don't just glitch or stop working,\" writes the Hollywood Reporter. \"They go full homicidal.\" With a cast that includes 1990s icons like Alicia Silverstone and the lead singer for the Napster-loving 1990s metal band Limp Bizkit, the movie \"gives the '90s the ending it deserved,\" according to the article. \nThey interviewed the film's director (and co-writer and co-star) Kyle Mooney, best-known for SNL, starting by complimenting this fidelity to the tech of its day. \"The film opens with a high schooler getting home and logging into AOL Instant Messenger, which is not a scene I think I've ever seen in another movie.\n\n\nMooney: All of my relationships, between 17 and 22 years old, were short-lived and spawned because I was most confident flirting on Instant Messager.... \n\nQ: The tech here is such a huge part of the story. Were there any logos or brands you had a tough time getting on camera? \n\n\nMooney: Definitely. This isn't really a spoiler, but Jaeden Martell's character's computer &mdash; the one that we open up with him logging into AOL &mdash; eventually turns into a robot. That was supposed to be an iMac. But I don't think Apple wanted their machines strangling people or whatever the robot does &mdash; so we had to change the look of it by, like, 30 percent. There were a few instances like that, where we couldn't get the exact thing, but we were allowed to get as close as possible.\n \nDeadline's article includes a spoiler about the film, but also this interesting note about two of its young actors, Julian Dennison and Jaeden Martell\"\n[A]lthough Dennison and Martell were both born after 2000, they enjoyed slipping into the \"lack of convenience and the lack of technology\" that came with the era. \n\n\"I wish I got to experience that. I wish I didn't live in the age of everything being so accessible,\" said Martell.\n \n\nAnd apparently the movie also incldues a quick shout-out to Myspace co-founder Tom Anderson.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Does+the+New+'Y2K'+Comedy%2FDisaster%2FHorror+Film+Give+the+'90s+the+Ending+It+Deserved%3F%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fentertainment.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F07%2F0050228%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fentertainment.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F07%2F0050228%2Fdoes-the-new-y2k-comedydisasterhorror-film-give-the-90s-the-ending-it-deserved%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/24/12/07/0050228/does-the-new-y2k-comedydisasterhorror-film-give-the-90s-the-ending-it-deserved?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23544107&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",
