The energy generated by the solar cells is used for driving or fed directly into the high-voltage battery... \n\nSolar paint has a high level of efficiency and contains no rare earths or silicon &mdash; only non-toxic, readily available raw materials. It is easy to recycle and considerably cheaper to produce than conventional solar modules. The Mercedes-Benz research department is currently working to enable use of the new solar paint on all exterior vehicle surfaces &mdash; regardless of shape or angle.\n \nSolar paint could power 62% of the travel for a typical Stuttgart driver, their announcement notes. But in a sunnier city like Los Angeles, \"It could be used for 100% of their driving, on average.\" (And \"the surplus of energy could be fed directly into the home network via bidirectional charging.\") \n\n Mercedes-Benz researchers \"initially thought the tech had limited scope for mass production,\" reports EV Central, \"until experiments were carried out with prototypes coated with the paint in real-world scenarios.\nInstead of just coating the roof and bonnet to form a 1.8-square-metre surface area, one scientist suggested covering an entire car with the new solar paint, ramping up the surface area to more than 11m2. Another difference to the [Mercedes-Benz 2022 Vision EQXX concept] is instead of wiring the body panels to the 12-volt system, scientists hardwired the body panels to the Benz's high-voltage battery and the performance of the paint was well beyond expectations... Available in all colours, engineers admit the solar paint work best in darker shades. When it's launched, the tech should be as durable as regular paint. The photovoltaic surface is protected by at least two protective lacquer finishes to ensure it isn't damaged in daily use. \n\nMercedes-Benz says the solar paint could mean \"increased electric range and fewer charging stops.\" And this is significant, because \"Electric vehicle charging and infrastructure are two major obstacles to EV adoption on a mass scale,\" writes Autoblog &mdash; arguing that Mercedes-Benz \"may have a solution... \"\nAlternative methods of energy harnessing could help alleviate range anxiety, increase an EV's driving distance, and reduce charging costs across the board. Not only that but considering the cost of producing Mercedes' solar coating and the lack of rare earth metals, it could be the leading solution to charging concerns... While the German automaker says the solar paint isn't ready for production on a mass scale, research, and development are progressing at a steady rate. If all goes well, we'll hopefully see solar coating as an accessory EV charging solution within the next decade. \n\nThanks to long-time Slashdot reader schwit1 for sharing the news.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status='Solar+Paint'+Being+Developed+By+Mercedes-Benz+Could+Revolutionize+EV+Charging%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F09%2F0242257%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F09%2F0242257%2Fsolar-paint-being-developed-by-mercedes-benz-could-revolutionize-ev-charging%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/12/09/0242257/solar-paint-being-developed-by-mercedes-benz-could-revolutionize-ev-charging?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23545735&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Slashdot's Interview with Bruce Perens: How He Hopes to Help 'Post Open' Developers Get Paid","url":"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/09/0344229/slashdots-interview-with-bruce-perens-how-he-hopes-to-help-post-open-developers-get-paid?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1733733240,"author":"EditorDavid","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Bruce Perens, original co-founder of the Open Source Initiative, has responded to questions from Slashdot readers about a new alternative he's developing that hopefully helps \"Post Open\" developers get paid. \nBut first, \"One of the things that's clear from the Slashdot patter is that people are not aware of what I've been doing, in general,\" Perens says. \"So, let's start by filling that in...\" \nRead on for the rest of his wide-ranging answers....<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Slashdot's+Interview+with+Bruce+Perens%3A++How+He+Hopes+to+Help+'Post+Open'+Developers+Get+Paid%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F09%2F0344229%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F09%2F0344229%2Fslashdots-interview-with-bruce-perens-how-he-hopes-to-help-post-open-developers-get-paid%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/09/0344229/slashdots-interview-with-bruce-perens-how-he-hopes-to-help-post-open-developers-get-paid?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23545783&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Raspberry Pi 500 Launches Along With Raspberry Pi Monitor","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Raspberry-Pi-500","date":1733741507,"author":"Michael Larabel","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Launched four years ago was the Raspberry Pi 400 as the Raspberry Pi 4 adapted for a keyboard form factor.

After all, it was a band of color-coordinated heroes who traded gentle quips and used martial arts to dispatch endless faceless baddies. I watched MMPR at the time, but I was also just cresting the age at which I felt a little embarrassed by its undeniable camp. Three decades later, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind once again feels a bit like it's riding the turtles' coattails. TMNT: Shredder's Revenge was an excellent retro brawler throwback, and by comparison, Rita's Rewind is a <em>pretty good</em> retro brawler throwback, but one with some of its own special charms--as well as its own frustrations.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Rita's Rewind fully recognizes the passage of time, even pinning down specific years. The original Rangers are still fighting evil in 2023, now against a mechanized Robo Rita--a timely reference to the villain of the reunion movie, 2023's Power Rangers: Once and Always. But apparently overwhelmed by these Rangers who have decades of experience, Robo Rita hatches a plan to go back in time and team up with her flesh-and-blood self. The modern-day Rangers say it's too dangerous to follow her through time and risk a paradox, so they just have to hope their younger selves are able to withstand the machinations of two Ritas.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That places Rita's Rewind strictly on the 1993 timeline, which means it's the first time the Rangers are encountering mainstays like Goldar and the Green Ranger. The only real difference is that this time we see Rita Repulsa bickering with Robo Rita over strategy.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-review-the-90s-sure-were-weird/1900-6418325/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1585/15855271/4411502-ss_47818674f66a0099c3a0f6b5e8cb68e6454acb86.jpg","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Zen and the Art of Aibo Engineering","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/aibo","date":1733752803,"author":"Tim Hornyak","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>An original Aibo engineer reflects on 25 years of Sony’s robot dog</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTEyOTE5Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODUzNjY0NX0.TP811badj_W0V_0vmLTeaXA-5RQHa8Sa-3LU3XEGKzs/image.jpg?width=600","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Everybody Loves FRED","url":"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/09/1312203/everybody-loves-fred?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1733752860,"author":"msmash","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"An anonymous reader shares a report: Fans post about him on social media. Swag bearing his name sells out on the regular. College professors dedicate class sessions and textbook sections to him. Foreign government officials have been known to express jealousy over his skills, and one prominent economist refers to him as a \"national treasure.\" Meet FRED, a 33-year-old data tool from St. Louis, Mo., and the economics world's most unlikely celebrity. \n\nEven if you have not interacted with FRED yourself, there is a good chance you've encountered him without knowing it. The tool's signature baby blue graphs dot social media and crop up on many of the world's most popular news websites. Many people feel that way about FRED. The website had nearly 15 million users last year, and it is on track for even more in 2024, up from fewer than 400,000 as recently as 2009. Their reasons for clicking are diverse: FRED users are coming for freshly released unemployment data, to check in on egg inflation or to find out whether business is booming in Memphis. \n\nThat appeal crosses political lines. Larry Kudlow, who directed the National Economic Council during the first Trump administration, has tweeted and retweeted FRED charts. Groups as disparate as the spending-focused Alaskans for a Sustainable Budget and the pro-worker advocacy organization Employ America have used its charts to back up their arguments. It is even occasionally used by professional and White House economists, who tend to have access to sophisticated data tools, for quick charts. \"It is unfathomable for me now, to think of the days before FRED,\" said Ernie Tedeschi, the director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale and a former chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers. \n\nWhen he speaks to foreign government economists, he noted, they are often \"jealous\" of the data tool, which is more comprehensive and easier to use than what other countries offer. \"It's a compliment to FRED,\" he said. FRED -- whose name stands for Federal Reserve Economic Data -- was born in 1991. But he was a sparkle in the eye of the St. Louis Fed long before that. The story started in the 1960s, with an economist named Homer Jones (now sometimes referred to as the \"grandfather of FRED\"). Mr. Jones was the director of research at the Fed's branch in St. Louis, and he wanted to make central bank decisions more data-based, so he started to mail typed data reports to Fed officials around the country.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Everybody+Loves+FRED%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F09%2F1312203%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F09%2F1312203%2Feverybody-loves-fred%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/09/1312203/everybody-loves-fred?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23546085&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Rust-Based, Memory-Safe PNG Decoders \"Vastly Outperform\" C-Based PNG Libraries","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Rust-PNG-Outperforms-C-PNG","date":1733753129,"author":"Michael Larabel","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Video and image encoders/decoders written in the Rust programming language for its memory safety guarantees is often viewed as one of the compelling areas for the programming language to better protect against malformed/malicious content especially within web browsers.

GIGATECH is building its technology stack natively on Alephium, a groundbreaking layer-one blockchain that offers unparalleled performances in the areas of scalability, security, programmability, and sustainability.</li>\n<li>Artificial Intelligence (AI): GIGATECH uses AI to power predictive analytics, enhance resource allocation, optimize yields, and automate decision-making processes, aiming to drive unprecedented levels of efficiency.</li>\n<li>Metaverse Digital Twins: By creating virtual replicas of physical systems, GIGATECH facilitates scenario modeling and real-time monitoring, enabling informed decision-making at a global scale in a visually intuitive environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"thefutureofsmartconnectivity\"><strong>The Future of Smart Connectivity</strong></h2>\n<p>GIGATECH envisions a future where “smart” meets “connected” in transformative ways. By integrating AI (“smart”) with blockchain technology (“connected”), the company is removing many of the existing frictions in global systems. However, in pursuit of a smart, connected future, it is equally imperative to ensure these cutting-edge digital infrastructures are carbon net zero themselves.</p>\n<p>\\\nOne of many exciting projects and partnerships being announced this week seeks to tackle this, GIGATECH is partnering with HEARST Corporation and Alephium to deliver the world’s first end-to-end tokenized green blockchain mining and AI datacentre projects, with a Wise Capital partnership with GIGACAPITAL for tokenized funding solutions.&nbsp; The POC project will be one of the first use cases for the GIGA Protocol and sews the seeds of ambition to substantially scale green blockchain mining and green data center projects globally in 2025.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“<em>Unlocking the vast potential of the transition era requires us to go beyond mere ambition; it demands a paradigm shift</em>,” said Heston Harper, CEO of GIGATECH. “<em>We must break free from the old, linear approaches that confine tomorrow to yesterday’s thinking. The climate-aligned economy isn’t just a future possibility—it IS the future.&nbsp; To build it, transparency and trust are non-negotiable. The GIGA Protocol is engineered to deliver these principles immutably, empowered by automated intelligence, to the areas that matter most. The global economy is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by policies and market forces that is sparking innovation across industries and supply chains. As stakeholders seize the opportunities of the transition era, the pace of change will only accelerate, at camp GIGATECH we are obsessively focussed at helping to unlock that collective action at an unprecedented scale</em>,”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/iRbOHPwIo2hED0rACW3cailrVtl2-2024-12-09T14:34:20.885Z-brp27l8u7cyna9mf2hvuywrc\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"aboutgigatech\"><strong>About GIGATECH</strong></h2>\n<p>GIGATECH is the technology division of the GIGATONS Group, dedicated to advancing the transition era with innovative solutions.

In an interview with The Verge, Suleyman, who oversees Microsoft's consumer AI products including Bing and Copilot, called current search interfaces \"completely broken\" and \"a total pain,\" arguing that voice-based AI interactions will prove \"100 times easier\" for users. He said: The UI that you experience is going to be automagically produced by an LLM in three or five years, and that is going to be the default. And they'll be representing the brands, businesses, influencers, celebrities, academics, activists, and organizations, just as each one of those stakeholders in society ended up getting a podcast, getting a website, writing a blog, maybe building an app, or using the telephone back in the day. \n\nThe technological revolution produces a new interface, which completely shuffles the way that things are distributed. And some organizations adapt really fast and they jump on board and it kind of transforms their businesses and their organizations, and some don't. There will be an adjustment. We'll look back by 2030 and be like, \"Oh, that really was the kind of moment when there was this true inflection point because these conversational AIs really are the primary way that we have these interactions.\" And so, you're absolutely right. A brand and a business are going to use that AI to talk to your personal companion AI because I don't really like doing that kind of shopping. And some people do, and they'll do that kind of direct-to-consumer browsing experience. Many people don't like it, and it's actually super frustrating, hard, and slow. \n\nAnd so, increasingly you'll come to work with your personal AI companion to go and be that interface, to go and negotiate, find great opportunities, and adapt them to your specific context. That'll just be a much more efficient protocol because AIs can talk to AIs in super real-time. And by the way, let's not fool ourselves. We already have this on the open web today. We have behind-the-scenes, real-time negotiation between buyers and sellers of ad space, or between search ranking algorithms. So, there's already that kind of marketplace of AIs. It's just not explicitly manifested in language. It's operating in vector space.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Microsoft+AI+Chief+Says+Conversational+AI+Will+Replace+Web+Browsers%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F09%2F1548200%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F09%2F1548200%2Fmicrosoft-ai-chief-says-conversational-ai-will-replace-web-browsers%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://slashdot.org/story/24/12/09/1548200/microsoft-ai-chief-says-conversational-ai-will-replace-web-browsers?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23546247&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"The HackerNoon Newsletter: Meet Āut Labs: HackerNoon Company of the Week (12/9/2024)","url":"https://hackernoon.com/12-9-2024-newsletter?source=rss","date":1733760303,"author":"Noonification","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"\n              \n        <p><strong>How are you, hacker?</strong></p>\n        <br />\n        <p>🪐 What’s happening in tech today, December 9, 2024?</p>\n        <br />\n        <p>\n          The\n          <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/noonification\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> HackerNoon Newsletter</a>\n          brings the HackerNoon \n          <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">homepage</a>\n          straight to your inbox.\n          <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/on-this-day\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">On this day,</a>\n          \n            <strong>Smallpox is Declared Eradicated</strong> in 1979,  <strong>Scarface Opened in US Theaters</strong> in 1983,  <strong>US Troops Stormed Mogadishu, Somalia</strong> in 1992, \n          \n          and  we present you with these top quality stories. \n          \n            From \n        <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/choosing-the-best-dictionary-in-c-part-2-unordered-containers\" class=\"eventTitle\"><strong>Choosing the Best Dictionary in C++.

He talked about hiring, work-life balance, and the challenges of scaling a global business. His words hit close to home for me as an entrepreneur, and I’d like to share my take on some of the points he raised.</p>\n<h3 id=\"theselfguidedmissilephilosophy\"><strong>The \"Self-Guided Missile\" Philosophy</strong></h3>\n<p>Nik has a straightforward rule: hire \"self-guided missiles.\" These are people who set their own goals, execute flawlessly, and deliver results without needing much guidance. If they don’t prove themselves in three months, they’re not the right fit.</p>\n<p>\\\nI fully agree with this. Finding such people is hard, but it’s possible. I’ve had the chance to work with individuals like this, and they are game-changers for any team. However, identifying them takes time and effort. Hiring isn’t just about interviews; it’s about spotting that rare mix of independence and drive. When you find them, they’re worth every moment spent searching.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"worklifebalanceisitoverrated\"><strong>Work-Life Balance: Is It Overrated?</strong></h3>\n<p>Nik’s take on balance is simple: it’s not for everyone. He believes success comes from sacrifice and imbalance. To win in the \"big sport\" of business, you need to focus 100% on your goals, even if it means giving up other parts of life.</p>\n<p>\\\nI tend to agree with him. It’s not a lifestyle that suits everyone, but it’s the reality of competing at the highest level. Building something impactful requires this kind of focus. If you’re willing to embrace it, the rewards can be extraordinary.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"globalambitionaboldvision\"><strong>Global Ambition: A Bold Vision</strong></h3>\n<p>Revolut wants to be the #1 fintech player in 40 markets with 30 million active users by 2027. That’s ambitious, and I respect it. Their product quality and speed of execution are inspiring. Scaling globally isn’t easy—it requires navigating different cultures, regulations, and markets. But their progress so far shows they know how to execute. When I hear goals like this, I feel motivated. Ambition, when paired with execution, is a force that can move mountains.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"exploringnewfrontiers\"><strong>Exploring New Frontiers</strong></h3>\n<p>Nik mentioned biotech and genetics as industries he’d like to explore. It reminded me of Walter Isaacson’s biography of Steve Jobs, where Jobs predicted these fields would drive the next breakthroughs. I couldn’t help but wonder: has Nik read that book?</p>\n<p>If I had the chance to explore a completely new field, I’d choose something similar. These areas promise innovation that could change the world, and I believe the next big thing will come from there.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"passionvsprogress\"><strong>Passion vs. Progress</strong></h3>\n<p>When asked why he does what he does, Nik’s answer was simple: “What else is there to do?” His mindset resonated with me. Success isn’t always about passion; sometimes it’s about the need to keep moving forward. It’s the thrill of building, solving problems, and creating something new that keeps us going. And yes, it’s enough.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"finalthoughts\">Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXubBqd8uXs\">Listening to Nik’s podcast</a> made me reflect on my own journey. His approach to hiring, work-life balance, and ambition is sharp, clear, and unapologetic. These are lessons every entrepreneur should think about, even if they don’t agree with everything.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhat do you think about Nik’s ideas? Would you embrace an imbalanced life for the sake of success? Let me know in the comments. Let’s discuss!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXubBqd8uXs&embedable=true\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXubBqd8uXs&embedable=true</a></p>\n<p>\\</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver 1&2 Remastered Review - My Wayward Son Returns","url":"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-12-remastered-review-my-wayward-son-returns/1900-6418324/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f","date":1733763600,"author":"Richard Wakeling","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p dir=\"ltr\">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver was ahead of its time when it launched in 1999 for the original PlayStation.

Developed in partnership with Crystal Dynamics and Aspyr--the latter of which recently launched the similarly packaged Tomb Raider I-III Remastered--this bundle reintroduces the world to vampire protagonist Raziel and his quest for revenge against the eponymous Kain. With improved visuals and a modern control scheme, it's a solid remaster that, above all, showcases why these games are so revered.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Set in the decaying land of Nosgoth--where vampires are apex predators and humans cower within walled cities--the first Soul Reaver begins with Raziel committing the sin of surpassing his master, Kain, in evolution. As the self-proclaimed king of Nosgoth, Kain sired and raised Raziel as his eldest lieutenant and son, tasking him and his four brothers with besieging the land and decimating humanity to ensure his despotic rule. By growing a set of wings, however, Raziel is deemed to have threatened Kain's supremacy and is thrown into the Lake of the Dead to suffer for all eternity. After rotting for centuries, Raziel is resurrected by a dormant god and set on a path of vengeance to seek out his brothers and kill them before doing the same to Kain.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-12-remastered-review-my-wayward-son-returns/1900-6418324/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/43/434805/4410692-newproject.jpg","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"NVIDIA R565 vs. Linux 6.13 + Mesa 25.0 Git AMD / Intel Graphics For Linux Gaming","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/review/nvidia-565-linux-613-mesa25","date":1733764324,"author":"Michael Larabel","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"It's been a few months since running any fresh Linux graphics driver comparison benchmarks.

The research demonstrated significant error reduction when scaling up from 3x3 to 7x7 grids of quantum bits, with errors dropping by half at each step. The advance addresses quantum computing's core challenge of maintaining stable quantum states, which typically last only microseconds. \n\nGoogle's new quantum chip, manufactured in-house, maintains quantum states for nearly 100 microseconds -- five times longer than previous versions. The company aims to build a full-scale system with about 1 million qubits, projecting costs around $1 billion by decade's end. \n\nIBM, Google's main rival, questioned the scalability of Google's \"surface code\" error correction approach, claiming it would require billions of qubits. IBM is pursuing an alternative three-dimensional design requiring new connector technology expected by 2026. The breakthrough parallels the first controlled nuclear chain reaction in 1942, according to MIT physics professor William Oliver, who noted that both achievements required years of engineering to realize theoretical predictions from decades earlier. \n\nFurther reading: Google: Meet Willow, our state-of-the-art quantum chip.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Scientific+Breakthrough+Gives+New+Hope+To+Building+Quantum+Computers%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F09%2F1715219%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F09%2F1715219%2Fscientific-breakthrough-gives-new-hope-to-building-quantum-computers%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/12/09/1715219/scientific-breakthrough-gives-new-hope-to-building-quantum-computers?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23546347&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"OpenAI’s Sora is launching today — here are highlights from the first review","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/09/openais-sora-is-launching-today-heres-highlights-from-the-first-review/","date":1733765061,"author":"Kyle Wiggers","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>Sora, OpenAI&#8217;s video generator, is launching Monday — at least for some users.

→ −100%. Now the Jensen-Chebyshev inequality implies that the left-hand side strictly exceeds the right-hand side, evaluated at the non-stochastic steady state. This implies that ∆ or Y must differ from their non-stochastic steady state values to restore equilibrium. The right-hand side is clearly increasing in ∆. Therefore to correct the imbalance ∆ would have to fall. However, this induces a contradiction since ∆ is convex in π for the relevant parametization. Hence Y must change to equilibriate the system. To see that it must fall take the derivative of the right-hand side</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-59930q2.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nsince when σ ≥ 1 the second term is non-negative and therefore unable to cancel the strictly positive first term.</p>\n<p>\\\nSharpness depends on parametric assumptions.

This approach inevitably leads to fragmented implementation, mounting cost and technical debt. Data system design requires specialized expertise across data modeling, distributed systems, security, and compliance. Most companies simply cannot afford dedicated data infrastructure teams in their early days and have to build and adapt their data systems as they grow.</p>\n<p>\\\nHowever, the path to evolve existing systems can be quite challenging. Teams often have to choose between lengthy migrations while maintaining multiple duplicate systems, or a costly full system cutover. Netscape’s decision to rewrite their browser engine in 1997 cost them their browser business and market dominance to Internet Explorer as they couldn’t compete with Internet Explorer’s rapid feature releases, eventually leading to their decline in market share. Many companies start with custom solutions and migrate to vendor platforms as they grow; however, even at the scale where companies can afford vendor platforms, they may still not fit their use cases and internal users must adapt to new workflows. Many companies end up building custom solutions on top of vendor platforms as they continue to scale. Internal infrastructure teams now have to maintain their original systems, operate vendor platforms, and support custom implementations on top of those platforms — while also training users across different tools and handling security and integrations across multiple systems. Due to lack of planning and organic progress as business scale, what started as a cheaper solution becomes significantly more costly and complex to operate.</p>\n<p>\\\nDesigning data platforms that can scale with business growth is more achievable today than before. Over the past decade, many organizations have established clear data usage patterns — product teams need user behavior data, marketing teams track campaign performance, finance teams monitor revenue metrics, and security teams analyze threat patterns. These common use cases are well-established in terms of what data they need and how quickly they need it. Rather than discovering requirements through costly migrations and retrofitting vendor solutions, it’s possible to build a data platform that can sustainably scale in terms of cost and operational efficiency.</p>\n<h1 id=\"designingdataplatforms\"><strong>Designing Data Platforms</strong></h1>\n<p>At its core, a data platform can be defined by two fundamental components: what data you need (data models) and how quickly you need it (latency requirements). Even with a loosely defined use case, understanding these two components allows us to systematically derive data collection mechanism and infrastructure needs.</p>\n<p>\\\nTake fraud risk detection for example. Typically, fraud risk requires three data components: identity, transaction and case management.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F790b22b3-ec1b-478a-8615-00114a2f7084_800x524.png\">  <img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F790b22b3-ec1b-478a-8615-00114a2f7084_800x524.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>Each data component can be mapped to infrastructure based on the latency needs. Identity and transaction verification require stream processing for real-time fraud detections, database processing handles ongoing monitoring and alerts, and data lakes to support longer-running tasks like pattern analysis and model training.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e1e2377-9408-4a25-a672-37d0236ab073_800x600.png\"> \\n  <img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e1e2377-9408-4a25-a672-37d0236ab073_800x600.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n<h1 id=\"datamodels\"><strong>Data Models</strong></h1>\n<p>A data model defines how data should be organized and standardized. It specifies a set of fields and their characteristics — the format, type, and rules for each field. The schemas enable data discovery, while definitions of individual fields determine governance policies and compliance requirements.</p>\n<p>\\\nWell-defined data models enable standardized data collection and processing across the organization. Take user data as an example — marketing needs it for campaign tracking, customer service for case management, product teams for behavior analytics, and risk teams for fraud detection. Without a shared user data model, every team builds their own version of user profiles and tracking logic. Teams end up creating complicated integrations to resolve and reconcile user data between systems. A shared data model serving as a single source of truth simplifies data collection and implementation, while consistent standards make security and compliance much easier to manage.</p>\n<p>Defining comprehensive data models is often difficult for individual teams as they typically focus on their immediate needs. Marketing teams focus on campaign-related fields, while risk teams focus on identity verification attributes. Without a holistic view of how the same data serves different functions, teams often create incomplete or narrowly-focused data models that require further processing and integrations between systems.</p>\n<h1 id=\"timerequirements\"><strong>Time Requirements</strong></h1>\n<p>Time requirements defines how quickly data needs to be processed and made available. Processing windows range from real-time (seconds) for immediate decisions, to near real-time (minutes) for monitoring, to batch processing (hours) for analytics and AI/ML applications. These time requirements map to specific infrastructure choices — streaming for real-time, databases for near real-time, and data lakes for batch processing.</p>\n<p>\\\nWithout a framework, product teams often build redundant infrastructure for similar needs — one team might use Kafka while another uses MSK for streaming, or one team might choose DynamoDB while another uses Cassandra for databases. This creates unnecessary complexity as teams maintain multiple systems with duplicate security controls and integrations.</p>\n<p>By standardizing infrastructure components, product teams no longer need to deploy their own infrastructure, and platform teams can reduce operational overhead by maintaining fewer systems. This standardization also enables better security controls, streamlined integrations, simplified observability, and optimized costs.</p>\n<h1 id=\"genericdataplatform\"><strong>Generic Data Platform</strong></h1>\n<p>A data platform architecture framework enables us to systematically derive data collection specifications, infrastructure requirements, security controls, and integration capabilities. This directly addresses the complexity and cost spiral that many organizations face today. Rather than teams building separate systems that platform teams struggle to support, a consistent framework simplifies security, compliance, integration, and cost management across the organization.</p>\n<p>\\\nWithout consistent implementation, platform teams are constantly asked to choose between maintaining existing systems, performing costly migrations, or building new features. Platform teams end up spending most of their time maintaining disparate systems and handling migrations instead of delivering business critical capabilities. A framework-driven approach enables organizations to scale their data platforms without disruptive migrations. Smaller organizations can start with necessary components and expand as they grow, and larger organizations can standardize their existing systems once without constant rewrite.</p>\n<h1 id=\"comingupnext\"><strong>Coming Up Next</strong></h1>\n<p>In Part 3 of the <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/tagged/one-off-to-one-data-platform\">“One Off to One Data Platform” series</a>, we’ll discuss how this framework can be implemented on a practical level. We’ll look into how common data platform components such as streaming, databases, data warehouse, and data lake can be assembled to support different business use cases with consistent security and compliance controls. As organizations grow, this modular approach allows teams to scale individual components independently while maintaining standardized interfaces and controls, eliminating the need for constant migrations. With a clear data platform architecture framework, organizations can build data applications that grow with their business rather than limiting it.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"How Vector Search Cracks the Code on Contract Analytics","url":"https://hackernoon.com/how-vector-search-cracks-the-code-on-contract-analytics?source=rss","date":1733777128,"author":"DataStax","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p><strong><em>A look at the application architecture of wealthAPI, a data analytics provider for the financial sector that has created a highly accurate way to identify recurring payment entries.</em></strong></p>\n<p>\\\nAt <a href=\"https://wealthapi.eu/en/\">wealthAPI</a>, we’ve always believed financial analytics should be smarter and faster, especially when identifying recurring payments hidden in transaction data.

Traditional methods struggled with scaling and often relied on exact matches, missing subtle differences (e.g., “Spotify” vs. “Spotify AB”).</p>\n<p>\\\nwealthAPI addresses this problem with an AI-driven approach that delivers accuracy and speed. At the heart of this solution lies <a href=\"https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-astra?utm_medium=byline&utm_source=hackernoon&utm_campaign=wealth-api&utm_content=wealth-api\">DataStax Astra DB</a>, a database platform purpose-built for modern, scalable, and AI-integrated workflows.</p>\n<h2 id=\"architecture\">Architecture</h2>\n<p>wealthAPI’s system takes raw bank transactions, processes them into embeddings, and groups them into recurring payment patterns — all powered by Astra DB’s vector similarity search capabilities. The architecture ensures scalability and responsiveness at each stage, even under high data volumes.</p>\n<p>\\\nHere’s a simplified flow of the process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Data ingestion -</strong> When bank transactions are received, the wealthAPI backend publishes them on a message queue for asynchronous processing.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Embedding creation -</strong> Each transaction (e.g., “Spotify, -10€, 22.10.24”) is transformed into a numeric vector (e.g., [0.12, 0.65, 0.78, …, 0.23]) using Astra DB’s vectorize feature.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Vector storage and search in Astra DB -</strong> The embeddings are stored in Astra DB, where lightning-fast vector similarity searches allow the system to find and cluster similar transactions.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Regularity analysis -</strong> The clusters are analyzed to identify recurring payments, categorizing them as contracts like “Spotify - music service - monthly\" or \"Health insurance - Health - yearly.\"</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\nAstra DB ensures the entire process is scalable and responsive, even with high volumes of data. The process also adheres to strict data security measures to ensure that end users and their transactions remain anonymous and protected from external access.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/qiQzyjN6LvaRDmVgSbd9gXT8bty2-kv034qk.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"technicalimplementation\">Technical Implementation</h2>\n<h3 id=\"clusteringtransactionsintocontracts\">Clustering transactions into contracts</h3>\n<p>Grouping transactions has always been a core challenge. Previous tools depended on exact matches (e.g., vendor name or payment amount), which often failed to capture variations and were slow to scale.</p>\n<p>\\\nAt wealthAPI, we tried searching for patterns among millions of transactions with traditional databases in the past, which was both slow and prone to errors. Even small variations in transaction details broke the clustering logic.</p>\n<p>\\\nBecause we’re using Astra DB, we can store embeddings and efficiently search for similar transactions, even with minor variations in details.</p>\n<p>\\\nHere’s an example: A payment labeled “Spotify AB” for €10 on one day and “Spotify” for €10 the next is correctly grouped as the same recurring payment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"handlinglargedatavolumes\">Handling Large Data Volumes</h3>\n<p>With thousands of transactions processed daily, wealthAPI required a database that could scale seamlessly while maintaining speed and accuracy.</p>\n<p>\\\nAstra DB’s foundation is Apache Cassandra, so it’s built for scalability.

In this article, I’ll explain how to easily implement tagged cache functionality based on an existing caching service.</h3>\n<p>\\\nImagine we have a system where users add articles. For each user, we display statistics about their articles in their personal dashboard: the number of articles, average word count, publication frequency, etc. To speed up the system, we cache this data. A unique cache key is created for each report.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe question arises: how to invalidate such caches when data changes? One approach is to manually clear the cache for each event, for instance, when a new article is added:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"php language-php\">class InvalidateArticleReportCacheOnArticleCreated {\n    public function handle(event: ArticleCreatedEvent): void {\n        this-&gt;cacheService-&gt;deleteMultiple([\n              'user_article_report_count_' . event-&gt;userId,\n              'user_article_report_word_avg_' . event-&gt;userId,\n              'user_article_report_freq_avg_' . event-&gt;userId,\n        ])\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nThis method works but becomes cumbersome when dealing with a large number of reports and keys. This is where tagged caching comes in handy. Tagged caching allows data to be associated not only with a key but also with an array of tags. Subsequently, all records associated with a specific tag can be invalidated, significantly simplifying the process.</p>\n<p>\\\nWriting a value to the cache with tags:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"php language-php\">this-&gt;taggedCacheService-&gt;set(\n    key: 'user_article_report_count_' . user-&gt;id,\n    value: value,\n    tagNames: [\n        'user_article_cache_tag_' . user-&gt;id,\n        'user_article_report_cache_tag_' . user-&gt;id,\n        'user_article_report'\n    ]\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nInvalidating the cache by tags:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"php language-php\">class UpdateCacheTagsOnArticleCreated {\n    public function handle(event: ArticleCreatedEvent): void {\n        this-&gt;taggedCacheService-&gt;updateTagsVersions([\n            'user_article_cache_tag_' . user-&gt;id,\n        ])\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nHere, the tag <code>'user_article_cache_tag_' . $user-&gt;id</code> represents changes in the user's articles. It can be used to invalidate any caches dependent on this data. A more specific tag <code>'user_article_report_cache_tag_' . $user-&gt;id</code> allows only the user's reports to be cleared, while a general tag <code>'user_article_report'</code> invalidates report caches for all users.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf your caching library does not support tagging, you can implement it yourself. The main idea is to store the current version values of tags, as well as for each value tagged, to store the tag versions that were current at the time the value was written to the cache. Then, when retrieving a value from the cache, the current tag versions are also retrieved, and their validity is checked by comparing them.</p>\n<p>\\\nCreating a <code>TaggedCache</code> class</p>\n<pre><code class=\"php language-php\">class TaggedCache {\n   private cacheService: cacheService\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nImplementing the <code>set</code> method for writing to the cache with tags. In this method, we need to write the value to the cache, as well as retrieve the current versions of the tags provided and save them associated with the specific cache key. This is achieved by using an additional key with a prefix added to the provided key.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"php language-php\">class TaggedCache {\n   private cacheService: cacheService\n\n    public function set(\n        key: string,\n        value: mixed,\n        tagNames: string[],\n        ttl: int\n    ): bool {\n        if (empty(tagNames)) {\n            return false\n        }\n\n        tagVersions = this-&gt;getTagsVersions(tagNames)\n\n        tagsCacheKey = this-&gt;getTagsCacheKey(key)\n\n          return this-&gt;cacheService-&gt;setMultiple(\n            [\n                key =&gt; value,\n                tagsCacheKey =&gt; tagVersions,\n            ],\n            ttl\n        )\n    }\n\n    private function getTagsVersions(tagNames: string[]): array&lt;string, string&gt; {\n        tagVersions = []\n\n        tagVersionKeys = []\n\n        foreach (tagNames as tagName) {\n            tagVersionKeys[tagName] = this-&gt;getTagVersionKey(tagName)\n        }\n\n        if (empty(tagVersionKeys)) {\n            return tagVersions\n        }\n\n        tagVersionsCache = this-&gt;cacheService-&gt;getMultiple(tagVersionKeys)\n\n        foreach (tagVersionKeys as tagName =&gt; tagVersionKey) {\n            if (empty(tagVersionsCache[tagVersionKey])) {\n                tagVersionsCache[tagVersionKey] = this-&gt;updateTagVersion(tagName)\n            }\n\n            tagVersions[$tagName] = tagVersionsCache[tagVersionKey]\n        }\n\n        return tagVersions\n    }\n\n    private function getTagVersionKey(tagName: string): string {\n        return 'tag_version_' . tagName\n    }\n\n    private function getTagsCacheKey(key: string): string {\n        return 'cache_tags_tagskeys_' . key\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nAdding the <code>get</code> method to retrieve tagged values from the cache. Here, we retrieve the value using the key, as well as the tag versions associated with that key. Then we check the validity of the tags. If any tag is invalid, the value is deleted from the cache and <code>null</code> is returned. If all tags are valid, the cached value is returned.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"php language-php\">class TaggedCache {\n    private cacheService: cacheService\n\n    public function get(key: string): mixed {\n        tagsCacheKey = this-&gt;getTagsCacheKey(key)\n\n        values = this-&gt;cacheService-&gt;getMultiple([key, tagsCacheKey])\n\n        if (empty(values[key]) || empty(values[tagsCacheKey])) {\n            return null\n        }\n\n        value = values[key]\n\n        tagVersions = values[tagsCacheKey]\n\n        if (! this-&gt;isTagVersionsValid(tagVersions)) {\n            this-&gt;cacheService-&gt;deleteMultiple([key, tagsCacheKey])\n\n            return null\n        }\n\n        return value\n    }\n\n    private function isTagVersionsValid(tagVersions: array&lt;string, string&gt;): bool {\n        tagNames = array_keys(tagVersions)\n\n        actualTagVersions = this-&gt;getTagsVersions(tagNames)\n\n        foreach (tagVersions as tagName =&gt; tagVersion) {\n            if (empty(actualTagVersions[tagName])) {\n                return false\n            }\n\n            if (actualTagVersions[tagName] !== tagVersion) {\n                return false\n            }\n        }\n\n        return true\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nImplementing the <code>updateTagsVersions</code> method to update tag versions. Here, we iterate over all the tags provided and update their versions using, for example, the current time as the version.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"php language-php\">class TaggedCache {\n    private cacheService: cacheService\n\n    public function updateTagsVersions(tagNames: string[]): void {\n        foreach (tagNames as tagName) {\n            this-&gt;updateTagVersion(tagName)\n        }\n    }\n\n    private function updateTagVersion(tagName: string): string {\n        tagKey = this-&gt;getTagVersionKey(tagName)\n\n        tagVersion = this-&gt;generateTagVersion()\n\n        return this-&gt;cacheService-&gt;set(tagKey, tagVersion) ? tagVersion : ''\n    }\n\n    private function generateTagVersion(): string {\n        return (string) hrtime(true)\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nThis approach is both convenient and universal. Tagged caching eliminates the need to manually specify all keys for invalidation, automating the process. However, it requires additional resources: storing tag version data and checking their validity with each request.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf your caching service is fast and not heavily constrained in size, this approach will not significantly affect performance. To minimize the load, you can combine tagged caching with local caching mechanisms.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn this way, tagged caching not only simplifies invalidation but also makes working with data more flexible and understandable, especially in complex systems with large amounts of interconnected data.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Lumoz Protocol Mainnet Launch: MOZ Tokens and Node Claims Now Open!","url":"https://hackernoon.com/lumoz-protocol-mainnet-launch-moz-tokens-and-node-claims-now-open?source=rss","date":1733778340,"author":"Lumoz (formerly Opside)","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>Abstract: With the official launch of the Lumoz Protocol mainnet, core features such as esMOZ and $MOZ token claims, esMOZ to $MOZ redemption, and zkVerifier License acquisition are now fully available to users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tothelumozcommunityandusers\"><strong>To the Lumoz Community and Users:</strong></h3>\n<p>Today, we are proud to announce the official launch of the Lumoz Protocol mainnet!

The verdict, which echoed a previously undisclosed finding from a 2020 US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigation, centered on discrimination claims based on race and national origin. Cognizant, based in Teaneck, New Jersey, was found to have preferred workers from India, most of whom joined the firm's US workforce of about 32,000 using skilled-worker visas called H-1Bs. \n\nThe case is part of a wave of recent discrimination claims against IT outsourcing companies that underscore growing concerns that these firms have exploited a broken employment-visa system to secure a cheaper, more malleable workforce. In the process, US workers say they've been disadvantaged. The industry, which provides computer services to other companies, makes extensive use of H-1Bs; over the past decade and a half, no employer has obtained more of them than Cognizant, federal records

Continuity and increasing requirements support the idea of the mean as an average and rule out alternative measures of location, such as median and mode.[106] The function space assumption allows us to include expectations of future variables, as part of our average ensemble.

Monotonicity and continuity follow from the following implicit function argument, where the left-hand side is (27), combined with (199) and the gross inflation definition (23) on the right-hand side</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-vvc30f7.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nHence</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-8bd30e6.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Corollary 3.</strong> <em>ZINSS is equivalent to a flexible price equilibrium.</em></p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-67e3048.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nTherefore uniquely at ZINSS the reset price constraint is not binding. This confirms the breakdown of nominal rigidity as the root cause of the bifurcation. The other weighted measures feature expectations of non-linear terms and are therefore not amenable to our definition.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Remark 36.</strong> <em>These results carry over easily to alternative settings with finite price lives. This includes Taylor pricing and models where the price spell is truncated, such as Wolman [1999] and Dixon and Le Bihan [2012].</em></p>\n<p>\\\nThe final result justifies a comment in Footnote 25 in Section 4.4. It explains the distinction between the reset price and the flexible price. Moreover, it presages the idea of a limiting fringe of flexible price firms, used in Section 9.5 to make distinctions between real and nominal rigidity.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Proposition 28.</strong> <em>The magnitude of the change in the reset price weakly exceeds the change in the price of a firm that always had flexible prices, with equality only when neither price changes.</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>Proof</em>. Since price re-setters are randomly assigned here, by a standard law of large numbers argument, the reset price inflation is given by</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-26f30xo.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nA flexible price firm will always set its price equal to the general price level</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-5lg30q5.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n(202) corresponds to Proposition 1, the economic idea that the relative price of the re-setter is increasing in inflation. Intuitively, with rigid prices to generate inflation or deflation, re-setters have to adjust more aggressively than in the flexible price world, in order to make up for the portion of the price level that does not change. This is why we cannot naively compare observed price changes with a classical benchmark to obtain the spillover from rigid prices to flexible prices.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.16214.pdf\">available on arxiv</a> under CC 4.0 license.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<hr />\n<p>[105] A reflexive space has the property that the set of possible ensemble averages and the set of possible realizations coincide.</p>\n<p>\\\n[106] Consult Bullen [2003] for a review of mean concepts and their inequalities.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Amazon forms an AI agent-focused lab led by Adept’s co-founder","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/09/amazon-forms-a-new-ai-agent-focused-lab-led-by-adept-co-founder/","date":1733783751,"author":"Kyle Wiggers","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>Amazon says that it&#8217;s establishing a new R&#38;D lab in San Francisco, the Amazon AGI SF Lab, to focus on building &#8220;foundational&#8221; capabilities for AI agents.

But I’ve abandoned so many projects in the past that it feels like the right time to work on building my dedication and commitment.</p>\n<p>Now, the first week of my 4-week journey is behind me, and if I had to sum it up in one word, it would be <em>different</em>. My goal this week was to focus on micro-tasks and test how consistent I could be. These tasks included things like drawing for 15 minutes, reading 30 pages of a technical book, and steering clear of sweets with added sugars.</p>\n<p>The image in the header features my self-made calendar, complete with cute wooden flowers that I use to mark each day I successfully complete my tasks. This week, I managed to earn those flowers for four days - not perfect, but far from failure. Let me tell you why.</p>\n<h3 id=\"morningroutinessmallchangesbigimpact\">Morning Routines: Small Changes, Big Impact</h3>\n<p>I started waking up an hour earlier each day (6:30am), feeling surprisingly refreshed. After a much-needed cold splash of water to my face I used this time to journal my thoughts, without focusing on my upcoming days, instead just reflecting on the past ones, noting down some important moments that I’d love to remember always. But I am curious, how many of you that started a journal actually went back to read a well-forgotten day in your lives? I guess I should keep a mental note to check up on my physical notes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workdayfindingbalance\">Workday: Finding Balance</h3>\n<p>To make my workday more intentional, I added 10-minute focus breaks every 90 minutes. During these breaks, I read my technical book, did some small sketches or simply stretched and took deep breaths, all the time contemplating if I should turn the 10 minutes into 20 😳. In all honesty, this micro change did switch up the rhythm and helped me extend my proactive workflow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"eveningstheonlypartofthedayicandowhatiwant\">Evenings: The only part of the day I can do what I want</h3>\n<p>The idea is to have at least three “out of the ordinary” evenings a week, this time I only managed to squeeze in two:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tuesday</strong>: My “mystery walk” through Amsterdam was an opportunity for me to feel comfortable when I’m not in control of the situation. Technically, I know I’m never truly in control; life is just a series of coincidental events steering me along, but I like to pretend otherwise by planning everything - knowing where I’m going, what to expect, and mapping out every step. This time I went out with my girlfriend and asked her to randomly pick the directions we took. Surprisingly, we ended up right at our metro station. Funny how the world works.</li>\n<li><strong>Sunday</strong>: Instead of the planned improv class, I tried rock climbing and bouldering. It was intimidating at first, looking up and seeing “you can break a leg” heights. So, the tactic I chose to fight this unexpected fear was taking one step at a time and only focusing on the next step - fastening the rope… pulling on the rope really tightly… pulling once again just to be sure… and next thing you know, I’m far too high from the ground to say it’s comfortable. But something about the process - being alone with my thoughts, planning my next move, and trusting my body to reach those milestones - made me feel incredibly in tune with myself. I’m someone who can’t do one pull-up and I had the wrong impression it’s going to stop me from reaching the top, so accomplishing that reminded me why I’m on this journey: to learn more about myself and push my limits.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"movingforward\">Moving Forward</h3>\n<p>I’d say I’ve done more than enough in the first week of this journey. One of my goals was to be kind to myself if things didn’t go as planned, and I believe I’ve done just that. How do I know? Well, reading through this blog brought a smile to my face. Now that I’ve experienced it, I’m even more excited to share week 2 with you. Here’s a small spoiler: it involves lasagnas and me finally starting to feel like I’m fitting in.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for week 2! And let me know if you've recently tried breaking any patterns - I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Musicians Rally Behind Internet Archive in $621 Million Music Label Battle","url":"https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/24/12/09/2218212/musicians-rally-behind-internet-archive-in-621-million-music-label-battle?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1733785200,"author":"msmash","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Over 300 musicians have signed an open letter defending the Internet Archive against a $621 million copyright infringement lawsuit over its preservation of 78 rpm records.

From a report: Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil told parliament Monday that the government needed to amend existing laws to tackle online harm including scams, cyber-bullying, and more. \"Freedom of speech does exist, but we are also given power through parliament to impose any necessary restrictions for the safety of the public,\" said Fahmi. \n\nThe bill imposes stricter penalties on content violations and grants sweeping powers to law enforcement, such as the right of any authorized officer to search and seize without a warrant. Service providers may also be held liable under the law, and compelled to disclose user data to authorities during investigations of alleged violations. More than 20 consultation sessions were held with stakeholders in the drafting of the bill, Fahmi said.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Malaysian+Lawmakers+Approve+Bill+To+Broaden+Internet+Control%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F10%2F0255200%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F10%2F0255200%2Fmalaysian-lawmakers-approve-bill-to-broaden-internet-control%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/12/10/0255200/malaysian-lawmakers-approve-bill-to-broaden-internet-control?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23546841&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Automattic acquires WPAI, a startup that makes AI products for WordPress","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/09/automattic-acquires-wpai-a-startup-that-creates-ai-solutions-for-wordpress/","date":1733801836,"author":"Ivan Mehta","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>WPAI's products include an AI plugin maker, an assistant for site builders, and a chatbot for WordPress-related questions. </p>\n<p>© 2024 TechCrunch.

From a report: Drylands now make up 40% of all land on Earth, excluding Antarctica. Three-quarters of the world's land suffered drier conditions in the past 30 years, which is likely to be permanent, according to the study by the UN Science Policy Interface, a body of scientists convened by the United Nations. \n\nAfrica lost about 12% of its GDP owing to the increasing aridity between 1990 and 2015, the report found. Even worse losses are forecast: Africa will lose about 16% of its GDP, and Asia close to 7%, in the next half decade. Ibrahim Thiaw, executive secretary of the UN convention to combat desertification (UNCCD), said: \"Unlike droughts -- temporary periods of low rainfall -- aridity represents a permanent, unrelenting transformation. Droughts end. When an area's climate becomes drier, however, the ability to return to previous conditions is lost. The drier climates now affecting vast lands across the globe will not return to how they were, and this change is redefining life on Earth.\" \n\nSome crops will be particularly at risk: maize yields are projected to halve in Kenya by 2050, if current trends continue. Drylands are areas where 90% of the rainfall is lost to evaporation, leaving only 10% for vegetation. Two-thirds of land globally will store less water by mid-century, according to the report published on Monday.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Drylands+Now+Make+Up+40%25+of+Land+on+Earth%2C+Excluding+Antarctica%2C+Study+Says%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F10%2F0357259%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F10%2F0357259%2Fdrylands-now-make-up-40-of-land-on-earth-excluding-antarctica-study-says%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/10/0357259/drylands-now-make-up-40-of-land-on-earth-excluding-antarctica-study-says?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23546883&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"China's Trillion-Dollar Bet on High-Speed Rail Transformation","url":"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/12/10/0634232/chinas-trillion-dollar-bet-on-high-speed-rail-transformation?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1733812500,"author":"msmash","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"China's high-speed rail network, which has tripled to nearly 30,000 miles under President Xi Jinping's leadership, faces mounting financial challenges amid aggressive expansion plans. China State Railway Group, the national operator, has accumulated nearly $1 trillion in debt and liabilities, requiring $25 billion annually for debt service. \n\nDespite this, plans call for adding 15,000 more miles by 2035. While flagship routes between major cities like Beijing and Shanghai remain profitable, newer lines into rural regions are struggling with low ridership. In Sichuan province's Fushun County, which received high-speed rail service in 2021, stations built for thousands sit largely empty despite having 12 high-speed rail stops within a 40-mile radius. \n\nThe expansion has become a symbol of China's technological advancement but raises concerns about economic viability. Ticket prices are maintained at about one-quarter of global averages to ensure public access, limiting profit potential. The railway operator turned a modest $460 million profit in 2023, aided by government subsidies, after three years of losses during the pandemic.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=China's+Trillion-Dollar+Bet+on+High-Speed+Rail+Transformation%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F10%2F0634232%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F10%2F0634232%2Fchinas-trillion-dollar-bet-on-high-speed-rail-transformation%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/12/10/0634232/chinas-trillion-dollar-bet-on-high-speed-rail-transformation?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23546983&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"E-commerce marketplace platform Mirakl acquires ad optimization startup Adspert","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/10/e-commerce-marketplace-platform-mirakl-acquires-ad-optimization-startup-adspert/","date":1733817600,"author":"Romain Dillet","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>French unicorn Mirakl is announcing its third acquisition in three years with the acquisition of Adspert, a German adtech startup focused on e-commerce advertising.
