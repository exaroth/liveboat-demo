As part of the expansion, Nvidia, which supplies the GPUs, and Dell and Super Micro, which have assembled the server racks for the computer, will establish operations in Memphis, the chamber said in a statement. \n\nThe Greater Memphis chamber (an economic development organization) called it \"the largest capital investment in the region's history,\" even saying that xAI \"is setting the stage for Memphis to become the global epicenter of artificial intelligence.\" (\"To facilitate this massive undertaking, the Greater Memphis Chamber established an xAI Special Operations Team... This team provides round-the-clock concierge service to the company.\") \n\nReuters calls the supercomputer \"a critical component of advancing Musk's AI efforts, as the billionaire has deepened his rivalry against OpenAI...\" And the Greater Memphis chamber describes the expansion by Nvidia/Dell/Super Micro as \"further solidifying the city's position as the 'Digital Delta'...

      "content": "The Carnegie Endowment for Peace, a nonpartisan international affairs think tank, points out that when subsea internet cables were cut in November, Europe was more prepared:\n\n\nWhere in the past there were no contingency plans for sabotage, there are now more maritime patrols, an attempt to forge deeper intelligence connections, and the beginnings of a new relationship with the private sector... \n\n\nEven before the October 2023 incident, NATO, the EU, and certain European governments began to increase their efforts to boost subsea cable resilience and security. In February 2023, NATO stood up a new Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to convene stakeholders and enhance coordination between the public and private sectors. In July 2023, NATO allies at the Vilnius Summit established a Maritime Center for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure as part of the alliance's Maritime Command in Northwood, UK. In October 2023, after the first incident, NATO defense ministers endorsed a new Digital Ocean Vision, an initiative aimed at improving undersea surveillance. And in February 2024, the European Commission released its first \"Recommendation on Secure and Resilient Submarine Cable Infrastructures,\" encouraging member states to conduct regular stress tests, improve information sharing amongst themselves, and improve cable maintenance and repair capabilities. \n\n\nThe article points out that the Chinese ship suspected in the 2023 cable cutting \"ignored requests from Finnish and Estonian authorities to halt\" and returned to China. But the Chinese ship suspected in November's cable-cutting \"remains in international waters in the Kattegat, with naval and coast guard vessels from Denmark, Germany, and Sweden circling close by.\" Yet \"Under international maritime law, these countries' authorities are not allowed to board...\"\n\n Current provisions of international law are neither formulated to adequately protect subsea data cables from sabotage nor hold perpetrators accountable. This reality should lead the EU, as a body inherently focused on the resilience of international legal regimes, to push for updates that are better suited for the current geopolitical reality... Lawmakers should also explore ways to increase penalties for subsea cable damage, in part to deter acts of sabotage in the first place.... \nA forthcoming Carnegie Endowment report will detail more in-depth recommendations on how Europe can both protect itself against future subsea cable damage and help expand trusted networks around the world. \n\nThe article also notes that \"Of the hundreds of disruptions to cables that occur each year, the vast majority are caused by accidental human activity, like fishing, or natural events, like earthquakes.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Is+Europe+Better+Prepared+to+Protect+Undersea+Internet+Cables%3F%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F0521225%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F0521225%2Fis-europe-better-prepared-to-protect-undersea-internet-cables%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/12/05/0521225/is-europe-better-prepared-to-protect-undersea-internet-cables?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23542101&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

At the same time, though, it has been difficult to check devices for infection, leading individuals to navigate an ad hoc array of academic institutions and NGOs that have been on the front lines of developing forensic techniques to detect mobile spyware. On Tuesday, the mobile device security firm iVerify is <a href=\"http://iverify.io/blog/iverify-mobile-threat-investigation-uncovers-new-pegasus-samples\">publishing findings</a> from a spyware detection feature it launched in May. Of 2,500 device scans that the company's customers elected to submit for inspection, seven revealed infections by the notorious NSO Group malware known as Pegasus.</p>\n<p>The company’s Mobile Threat Hunting feature uses a combination of malware signature-based detection, heuristics, and machine learning to look for anomalies in iOS and Android device activity or telltale signs of spyware infection. For paying iVerify customers, the tool regularly checks devices for potential compromise. But the company also offers a free version of the feature for anyone who downloads the iVerify Basics app for $1. These users can walk through steps to generate and send a special diagnostic utility file to iVerify and receive analysis within hours. Free users can use the tool once a month. iVerify's infrastructure is built to be privacy-preserving, but to run the Mobile Threat Hunting feature, users must enter an email address so the company has a way to contact them if a scan turns up spyware—as it did in the seven recent Pegasus discoveries.</p>\n<p>“The really fascinating thing is that the people who were targeted were not just journalists and activists, but business leaders, people running commercial enterprises, people in government positions,” says Rocky Cole, chief operating officer of iVerify and a former US National Security Agency analyst. “It looks a lot more like the targeting profile of your average piece of malware or your average APT group than it does the narrative that’s been out there that mercenary spyware is being abused to target activists. It is doing that, absolutely, but this cross section of society was surprising to find.”</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/12/1-phone-scanner-finds-seven-pegasus-spyware-infections/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/12/1-phone-scanner-finds-seven-pegasus-spyware-infections/#comments\">Comments</a></p>\n\n            ",

      "content": "11 years ago his hard drive ended up in a U.K. landfill &mdash; with 8,000 bitcoin. It's now worth $800 million... and James Howell wants it back. \n\nThe Guardian reports that his \"bid to become extremely rich reached a judge on Tuesday with a team of lawyers arguing that it was still possible to launch a hunt for his missing hard drive containing the bitcoin.\"\n\nThey claimed that rather than searching for a \"needle in a haystack\", the position of the bitcoin hoard had been narrowed down to a small area and there was a \"finely tuned\" plan to retrieve it... [Howells] has been asking Newport city council for help in getting the hard drive back, and even said he would share the money with the authority, to no avail... James Goudie KC, representing the council, said Howells had no legal claim to the hard drive. He said: \"Anything that goes into the landfill goes into the council's ownership.\" \n\nGoudie said Howells' offer to share some of the bitcoin with Newport council amounted to a bribe. He said: \"He is trying to buy something the council is not in a position to sell....\" Before the hearing, a spokesperson for Newport council said: \"The council has told Mr Howells multiple times that excavation is not possible under our environmental permit and that work of that nature would have a huge negative environmental impact on the surrounding area. \"Responding to Mr Howells' baseless claims are costing the council and Newport taxpayers time and money which could be better spent on delivering services.\"\n \n\nHowells was 28 when he lost the hard drive, and has said he may as well keep trying to recover it &mdash; because he'll always know that it's out there. Howells' legal teams are \"working pro bono,\" the article notes, \"on the basis that they get a share of the bitcoin profits if successful...\" And TechSpot points out that \"There's also the question of whether the data on the drive would still be accessible after more than a decade of sitting under a pile of rotting garbage. \n\n\"Howells has a team of data recovery engineers who are also working pro bono...\" \n\nThanks to Slashdot reader jjslash for sharing the news.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Hard+Drive+Tossed+in+Landfill+With+Bitcoin+Now+Worth+%24800+Million.+Lawsuits+Continue%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F1756216%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F1756216%2Fhard-drive-tossed-in-landfill-with-bitcoin-now-worth-800-million-lawsuits-continue%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/05/1756216/hard-drive-tossed-in-landfill-with-bitcoin-now-worth-800-million-lawsuits-continue?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23542665&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

Supply chain security firm Socket reports that Solana's Web3.js library was hijacked to push out two malicious versions to steal private and secret cryptography keys to secure wallets and sign transactions... Solana confirmed the breach, stating that one of their publish-access accounts was compromised, allowing the attackers to publish two malicious versions of the library... Solana is warning developers who suspect they were compromised to immediately upgrade to the latest v1.95.8 release and to rotate any keys, including multisigs, program authorities, and server keypairs... \n\nOnce the threat actors gain access to these keys, they can load them into their own wallets and remotely drain all stored cryptocurrency and NFTs... Socket says the attack has been traced to the FnvLGtucz4E1ppJHRTev6Qv4X7g8Pw6WPStHCcbAKbfx Solana address, which currently contains 674.86 Solana and varying amounts of the Irish Pepe , Star Atlas, Jupiter, USD Coin, Santa Hat, Pepe on Fire, Bonk, catwifhat, and Genopets Ki tokens. Solscan shows that the estimated value of the stolen cryptocurrency is $184,000 at the time of this writing. \n\nFor anyone whose wallets were compromised in this supply chain attack, you should immediately transfer any remaining funds to a new wallet and discontinue the use of the old one as the private keys are now compromised.\n \n Ars Technica adds that \"In social media posts, one person claimed to have lost $20,000 in the hack.\" \nThe compromised library \"receives more than ~350,000 weekly downloads on npm,\" Socket posted.

Even 42 years later, Rob Bottin's practical effects are still incredible, capturing each freakish amalgamation of tentacles, sharp teeth, sinew, and traces of malformed humanity with ghastly clarity. I've seen The Thing dozens of times, yet seeing Norris' decapitated head contort and grow arthropod-esque legs will never fail to twist my stomach in knots. These are the everlasting images of The Thing, but it's the alien's ability to perfectly imitate anyone that genuinely terrifies, permeating each scene with an unnerving sense of dread and paranoia that affects both its characters and the audience watching. Who do you trust when anyone could be a clandestine threat?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Back in 2002, developer Computer Artworks attempted to translate this feeling into an officially licensed video game for The Thing. The now-shuttered studio came close to succeeding, too, creating a third-person horror-action game with a unique squad system that ensured you could never entirely trust the person fighting by your side. It's become somewhat of a cult classic since then, leading to this remaster from Nightdive Studios--a developer known for faithfully restoring myriad games, including Shadow Man and Star Wars: Dark Forces. The Thing: Remastered is a similarly authentic experience, albeit with a number of key improvements to the game's visuals, controls, and some quality-of-life mechanics. Beyond this, it's much the same game as it was in 2002, for both the good and the bad.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4410531-thethingremastered-augustscreenshot%282%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4410531\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4410531-thethingremastered-augustscreenshot%282%29.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4410531-thethingremastered-augustscreenshot%282%29.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4410531-thethingremastered-augustscreenshot%282%29.jpg 3840w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4410531-thethingremastered-augustscreenshot%282%29.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/43/434805/4410531-thethingremastered-augustscreenshot%282%29.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">The game's setup is one of its better aspects, acting as a direct sequel to John Carpenter's iconic 1982 film. You play as the bland, one-dimensional Captain Blake, leader of a U.S. Special Forces rescue team sent to investigate Outpost 31 in the isolating tundra of Antarctica. Of course, we know what transpired when MacReady and the rest of this research facility encountered the shape-shifting alien life-form, and it doesn't take long before Blake is fighting off all manner of horrific entities. He's rather nonchalant about the whole thing, though, anchoring a relatively thin story that feels distinctly 2002 in all the worst ways. While it begins as a more action-oriented facsimile of the film it's ostensibly a sequel to, the narrative quickly delves into predictable territory with the military experimenting on the Thing to use the alien for its own gain. It's all very stereotypical, with melodramatic voice acting and--aside from a fun cameo from John Carpenter himself--an inherently disposable cast of characters.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-thing-remastered-review-cold-fear/1900-6418323/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",

      "content": "<p>What is the one thing we all need to ask before we leave the house each morning?</p>\n<p>\\\n“What’s the weather going to be like today?”</p>\n<p>\\\nLuckily, we live in the transformational age of advanced and ever-evolving technology, and we now have the gift of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML).</p>\n<p>\\\nBy looking at years of weather data and pairing it with known weather patterns and outside factors, computers can now predict the weather like never before.</p>\n<p>\\\nFor instance, during the Paris Olympics this year, AI tools were used to provide a daily forecast of weather conditions.</p>\n<p>\\\nRecent advances in ML-based weather prediction (MLWP) have produced ML-based models with <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08252-9\">less forecast error</a> than simpler past models.</p>\n<p>\\\nAs <a href=\"https://eos.org/editor-highlights/machine-learning-masters-weather-prediction\">noted</a> by the science news magazine <em>EOS</em>, “It took fifty years to build and incrementally improve the sophisticated computer models needed to produce such accurate forecasts. It has taken ML approaches just a couple of years to match, and in some cases surpass, the skill of these traditional models.”</p>\n<p>\\\nNow, Google DeepMind scientists have developed a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/07/22/google-ai-weather-climate-forecast-model\">weather model</a> that largely beats the world’s most accurate modeling system. </p>\n<p>\\\nResearchers believe the model may be able to accurately predict unprecedented events that climate change accentuates.</p>\n<p>\\\nAccording to a report last month <a href=\"https://iccwbo.org/news-publications/policies-reports/new-report-extreme-weather-events-cost-economy-2-trillion-over-the-last-decade/\">commissioned by the International Chamber of Commerce</a>, “climate-related extreme weather events have cost the global economy more than $2 trillion over the past decade.”</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://www.maginative.com/article/gencast-a-new-weather-ai-from-google-deepmind-outperforms-leading-weather-forecasting-systems/\">According to Maginative</a>, “Google DeepMind’s new high-resolution AI model, GenCast, delivers faster, more accurate weather predictions than traditional methods. AI will fundamentally change how we plan for everyday weather and extreme events.”</p>\n<p>\\\nPart of the reason why this is such a significant development is because GenCast offers weather forecasts that are not only more reliable but also faster. Unlike traditional methods that rely on supercomputers and take hours, GenCast runs on a single TPU chip in just eight minutes, predicting a wide range of possible outcomes rather than a single scenario, as current weather prediction models do.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn contrast to traditional models, which make forecasts by solving physics equations, GenCast learns directly from historical weather data.</p>\n<p>\\\nJacob Mallinder, in CEO Today,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ceotodaymagazine.com/2024/12/9-must-know-ai-weather-forecasting-innovations/\">outlines some of the top AI innovations</a>&nbsp;that are&nbsp;making a difference in weather forecasting today.</p>\n<p>\\\nHe explains that aside from improved data gathering and predictive analytics, AI today allows for insight into climate change, agricultural optimization, improving efficiency in the energy sector, and enhancing aviation safety.</p>\n<p>\\\nMAELSTROM is another <a href=\"https://www.maelstrom-eurohpc.eu/\">large-scale R&D project</a>, aiming to fundamentally improve weather and climate prediction. It aims to combine the powers of high-performance computing (HPC) and ML to cope with the extreme complexity inherent in weather and climate forecasts.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn August, NVIDIA Research <a href=\"https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2024-08_kilometer-scale-convection-allowing-model-emulation-using-generative-diffusion\">announced a new generative AI model</a>, dubbed StormCast, for emulating high-fidelity atmospheric dynamics.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe model was built to provide reliable weather prediction at the mesoscale — a scale larger than storms but smaller than cyclones — which is critical for disaster planning and mitigation.</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://quantumcomputingreport.com/quantum-for-ai-weather-forecasting-are-we-there-yet/\">Quantum ML is another option</a>, but some experts believe it is not the optimal way to go as quantum computing is still in the early stages of development.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf it is the case that GenCast and other emerging technologies can predict serious weather events, it will introduce a monumental change. With such abilities, we can warn people ahead of time and prevent traffic accidents. Farmers can plan their farming and prevent crop loss. Energy companies will be able to run more effectively if they can understand sun and wind patterns in advance.</p>\n<p>\\\nAnd when we walk out the door, we won’t need to wonder what the weather will be like because we’ll already know.</p>",

      "content": "Wednesday Cuba's energy grid collapsed, \"leaving millions without power,\" CNN reported, calling it \"the latest in a series of failures on an island struggling from creaking infrastructure, natural disasters and economic turmoil.\" \n\nToday Reuters reports:\n\n Cuba said it had reconnected its national electrical grid on Thursday, though generation remained well below demand one day after a plant failure knocked out power to millions across the island... Around half of Cuba's power generation facilities are offline for maintenance or broken down. All are decades old and producing well under capacity. \n\nAs a result, a majority of Cuba's residents suffer hours-long, rolling blackouts on a daily basis even when the grid is functional. Cuba's electrical grid has been on the brink of collapse for years, as fuel shortages, a string of natural disasters and an economic crisis have left the island's government unable to maintain the system's decrepit infrastructure. Dwindling oil imports from Venezuela, Russia and Mexico tipped the system into full crisis this year, leading to several nationwide blackouts that have sparked unrest and increasing anger among the population. The blackouts, together with food, medicine and water shortages, have vastly complicated life on the island and driven a record-breaking exodus of its residents since 2020. \n\nAuthorities informed Cuba's citizens that scheduled power outages will now resume, reports ABC News. \"Cuban authorities said they will continue their current practice of implementing daily, five-hour power outages by block or zone as they have been doing for the past few months.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Millions+of+Cubans+Had+Another+Power+Outage+Wednesday%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F220211%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F220211%2Fmillions-of-cubans-had-another-power-outage-wednesday%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/24/12/05/220211/millions-of-cubans-had-another-power-outage-wednesday?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23542899&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

The coin’s value quickly climbed to nearly $500 million, but within 20 minutes, it plummeted by 88%, dropping to around $66 million in total value. The crypto community on X is in an uproar, with some claiming that Hailey is responsible for what they’re calling a “rug pull” — a project intentionally abandoned by its developers to run off with investor money.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-46536fy.png\" alt=\"$Hawk takes a steep dive\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nSome speculate that, since Hailey just got familiar with the power of crypto and was “orange-pilled” (converted into a serious Bitcoin advocate) only a few weeks ago, she was likely taken advantage of by those more experienced in the tokenomics of launching a successful project. The theory? Her team or advisers may have orchestrated the whole thing to run off with millions of dollars after the token’s value crashed.</p>\n<p>\\\nHailey took to X Spaces, an open audio group chat, to share her side of the story. The Space, cheekily titled&nbsp;<em>The Hawk Truth,</em>&nbsp;featured little commentary from Hailey herself. Instead, an alleged project organizer known as @overHeRE on X defended the project, claiming it was not a rug pull and insisting that Hailey and her team are not abandoning the project. </p>\n<p>\\\nAccording to community notes on X: “96% of the $HAWK supply is in 10 connected addresses before the launch.” Suggesting that Hailey’s team has nearly total control over the sustaining value of the coin.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis story is very much ongoing. Some people claim to have lost their life savings and sizable investments on the token, expecting the memecoin to make them major profits. Naturally, these investors are upset and regretful, while more seasoned crypto traders are scolding anyone naive enough to invest in a “Hawk Tuah” memecoin.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whenusersinthedigitaltownhallaccusedhaileyandquestionedherabouthowmuchmoneywasmadeduringtheriseandfallofhernewtokenhaileyinterjectedsaying\">When users in the digital town hall accused Hailey and questioned her about how much money was made during the rise and fall of her new token, Hailey interjected, saying,</h2>\n<p>\\\n<em><a href=\"https://youtu.be/4IVpzmkHBEU?si=cHfBxreMGMFvKerp&t=3784\">“Hey guys, I hate to interrupt you, but anywho, I’m going to bed.

It's the first time when MachineGames breaks loose from its linear shackles, presenting you with a massive play area to freely explore. I went from gawking at Michelangelo's masterpiece on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel to exploring the ancient ruins hidden deep beneath the holy city, spending more than three hours on this single level alone without coming close to completing every task in Indy's journal.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It's not quite what I expected from a studio known for its frenetic shooters, nor a game that's been described as a first-person action-adventure. For the most part, The Great Circle is a stealth game that resembles Dishonored more than any of MachineGames' previous output. Sure, you could skulk through the shadows in Wolfenstein, plunging knives into Nazi spines, but it was a shooter first and foremost. The Great Circle has moments of action, but its violence is sudden and tends to end quickly, indicative of Indiana Jones as a character; it wouldn't make sense if he were running and gunning like BJ Blazkowicz. It's a refreshing change of pace for the studio, and it's a rip-roaring good time, even if the inexperience of creating this sort of game sometimes shows.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In terms of story and tone, MachineGames definitely understood the assignment. The Great Circle's prologue is essentially a love letter to Raiders of the Lost Ark, immediately making it clear how much the studio both grasps and reveres the series and its globe-trotting protagonist. This feeling persists throughout the entire game, beginning with an opening level that takes place inside the fictional walls of Marshall College, where Indy teaches archeology. The Great Circle is set between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, weaving into the existing fabric of the series in a way that makes it feel like a natural extension of Indy's story. A few familiar faces return, and new characters seamlessly blend into its cinematic world, contributing to a compelling adventure that sees you travel the world, uncover ancient mysteries, and butt heads with the Axis powers.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",

      "content": "Today a group of German scientists presented data suggesting Earth is absorbing more sunlight than in the past, reports Ars Technica, \"largely due to reduced cloud cover.\"\n\n\nWe can measure both the amount of energy the Earth receives from the Sun and how much energy it radiates back into space.... The new paper finds that the energy imbalance set a new high in 2023, with a record amount of energy being absorbed by the ocean/atmosphere system. This wasn't accompanied by a drop in infrared emissions from the Earth, suggesting it wasn't due to greenhouse gases, which trap heat by absorbing this radiation. Instead, it seems to be due to decreased reflection of incoming sunlight by the Earth.... \n\nUsing two different data sets, the teams identify the areas most effected by this, and they're not at the poles, indicating loss of snow and ice are unlikely to be the cause. Instead, the key contributor appears to be the loss of low-level clouds [particularly over the Atlantic ocean]... The drop in low-level clouds had been averaging about 1.3 percent per decade. 2023 saw a slightly larger drop occur in just one year.... \n\nSo, what could be causing the clouds to go away? The researchers list three potential factors. One is simply the variability of the climate system, meaning 2023 might have just been an extremely unusual year, and things will revert to trends in the ensuing years. The second is the impact of aerosols, which both we and natural processes emit in copious quantities. These can help seed clouds, so a reduction of aerosols (driven by things like pollution control measures) could potentially account for this effect. The most concerning potential explanation, however, is that there may be a feedback relationship between rising temperatures and low-level clouds. Meaning that, as the Earth warms, the clouds become sparse, enhancing the warming further. That would be bad news for our future climate, because it suggests that the lower range of warming estimates would have to be adjusted upward to account for it. \n\nIf the decline in reflectivity wasn't just caused by normal variability, the researchers warn, \"the 2023 extra heat may be here to stay...\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Earth+Began+Absorbing+More+Sunlight+in+2023%2C+Climate+Researchers+Find%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F2324206%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F2324206%2Fearth-began-absorbing-more-sunlight-in-2023-climate-researchers-find%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/05/2324206/earth-began-absorbing-more-sunlight-in-2023-climate-researchers-find?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23542979&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

      "content": "Wednesday OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced \"12 Days of OpenAI,\" promising that \"Each weekday, we will have a livestream with a launch or demo...\" And sure enough, today he announced the launch of two things: \n- \"o1, the smartest model in the world. Smarter, faster, and more features (e.g. multimodality) than o1-preview. Live in ChatGPT now, coming to API soon.\" \n\n- \"ChatGPT Pro. $200/month. Unlimited usage and even-smarter mode for using o1. More benefits to come!\" \n\nAltman added this update later:\nFor extra clarity: o1 is available in our plus tier, for $20/month. With the new pro tier ($200/month), it can think even harder for the hardest problems. Most users will be very happy with o1 in the plus tier! \n VentureBeat points out that subscribers \"also gain access to GPT-4o, known for its advanced natural language generation capabilities, and the Advanced Voice feature for speech-based interactions.\" \n\nAnd even for non-subscribers, ChatGPT can now also analyze images, points out VentureBeat, \"a hugely helpful feature upgrade as it enables users to upload photos and have the AI chatbot respond to them, giving them detailed plans on how to build a birdhouse entirely from a single candid photo of one, for one fun example.\"\n\nIn another, potentially more serious and impressive example, it is now capable of helping design data centers from sketches... o1 represents a significant evolution in reasoning model capabilities, including better handling of complex tasks, image-based reasoning, and enhanced accuracy. Enterprise and Education users will gain access to the model next week... OpenAI's updates also include safety enhancements, with the o1-preview scoring 84 on a rigorous safety test, compared to 22 for its predecessor... \n\nTo encourage the use of AI in societal-benefit fields, OpenAI has announced the ChatGPT Pro Grant Program. The initiative will initially award 10 grants to leading medical researchers, providing free access to ChatGPT Pro tools.\n \nIn a video Altman displays graphs showing o1 dramatically outperforms gpt4o on math questions, on competition coding at CodeForces, and on PhD-level science questions.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=OpenAI+Releases+'Smarter%2C+Faster'+ChatGPT+-+Plus+%24200-a-Month+Subscriptions+for+'Even-Smarter+Mode'%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F06%2F0121217%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F06%2F0121217%2Fopenai-releases-smarter-faster-chatgpt---plus-200-a-month-subscriptions-for-even-smarter-mode%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://slashdot.org/story/24/12/06/0121217/openai-releases-smarter-faster-chatgpt---plus-200-a-month-subscriptions-for-even-smarter-mode?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23543071&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

      "content": "<p>I had written memecoin stories before their hype cycle started …</p>\n<p>\\\nAnd before, life happened and I stopped writing those all together…</p>\n<p>\\\nBut today, I felt like doing it again, so here we are.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebeginning\">The Beginning</h2>\n<p>The story started about 5 months ago, when one of those random street interview videos went viral.</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/dFnV3qDpNLY\">https://youtu.be/dFnV3qDpNLY</a></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong><em>What’s a wild move in bed that makes men crazy every time?</em></strong></p>\n<p>\\\nThat’s the question that Hailey Welch got on an on-the-street interview in Nashville, and now, millions know her answer, and people on the internet elevated her to celebrity status (I will spare you the whole “the state of society” rant, so don’t worry…).</p>\n<p>\\\nUnlike the crazy airplane woman though, the Hawk Tuah girl was able to keep her fame alive for longer than 15 minutes. Even more so, she leveraged and monetized it.</p>\n<p>\\\nShe sold branded merchandise, launched the “Talk Tuah” podcast, and was paid to appear at different events.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thememecoin\">The Memecoin</h2>\n<p>Hawk Tuah became one of the most popular memes, and a few months later, it was also going to become a memecoin too…</p>\n<p>\\\nWhat’s the big deal though?</p>\n<p>\\\nCelebrity tokens and memecoins are launched too often these days. Most of them are rugs, majority of those celebrities are grifters… It’s an old story - who cares, right?</p>\n<p>\\\nWell, many cared enough to put their money into $Hawk, and … yup (spoiler alert), lost it.</p>\n<p>\\\nAt this point, unfortunately, that’s not surprising at all though…</p>\n<p>\\\nAnyway, let’s check what happened with this one.</p>\n<p>\\\nAt the end of last month, Hailey let everyone know that she was launching a memecoin on Dec 4th.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhere?</p>\n<p>\\\nOf course where the epicenter of the degen shitshow is: Solana (in my opinion, exactly where her shitcoin belonged…). </p>\n<p>\\\nShe started collecting SOL wallet addresses for free airdrop…</p>\n<p>\\\nThen, the 4th of December came, and she tweeted a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/HalieyWelchX/status/1864434514610782583\">3 sec video</a>&nbsp;saying the coin was live.</p>\n<p>\\\nAnd then…</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/sZgLpNbOPtQFz0sTBASstUpb7kG2-cs0340y.png\" alt=\"\" />This happened…</p>\n<p>\\\nThe drop was so steep and fast that the memecoin degens who put their hopes of getting a Lambo on $HAWK profits ended up being the exit liquidity…</p>\n<p>\\\nProbably they’re already used to it by now…I’ve even heard some say it’s “part of the game”, but still, even if they ask for it - they may not deserve it… or … do they?</p>\n<h2 id=\"thetokenomics\">The Tokenomics</h2>\n<p>For those who have seen similar charts and still have no clue what happens behind the scenes - here is the summary of what seems to have happened in this particular case.</p>\n<p>\\\nLet’s look at “tokenomics” (I can imagine the talks about it among the team while coming up with the numbers lol…)</p>\n<p>\\\nHayley was told&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/HalieyWelchX/status/1864448384326881713\">to copy and paste it for us guys</a>&nbsp;:)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/sZgLpNbOPtQFz0sTBASstUpb7kG2-7u134b3.png\" alt=\"\" />So, here it is.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/sZgLpNbOPtQFz0sTBASstUpb7kG2-qb234xi.png\" alt=\"\" />According to the team, those 17% were SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) - basically presale…</p>\n<p>\\\nBut who in their right mind makes those FULLY UNLOCKED?…</p>\n<p>\\\nMeaning those who get them can dump those tokens at the same minute they are issued … which is exactly what it feels like they did.</p>\n<p>\\\nNow, that’s what the team says… which may or may not be true.</p>\n<p>\\\nHaving them unlocked is already bad enough… but hey, we’re in crypto - who knows who those wallets belong to… maybe the team rolled out a few hundred wallets themselves?…</p>\n<p>\\\nNot saying that’s the case - all I am saying is we can see which are those wallets, but there is no way to prove who they belong to - is there?</p>\n<p>\\\nWhoever those wallets belonged to - they already made tons of money at this point.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong><em>Now, compare that 17% to the miserable 2% allocated to the public sale…</em></strong></p>\n<p>\\\nOne doesn’t have to be a rocket scientist to know how wrong and how fast this could go, right?</p>\n<p>\\\nOk, so now add to it the fact that many were not even able to get anything from that 2%.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhy?</p>\n<p>\\\nWell because a sniper jumped in, sniped most of it - and then immediately sold it … walking out with millions (unlike you guys - he can now buy a Lambo!)</p>\n<p>\\\nWho else made millions although it might look like they themselves did not sell a single token?</p>\n<p>\\\nThe team.</p>\n<p>\\\nLooks like they had a fee set - which means that thanks to the sniper and other trades they too made a substantial amount in fees.</p>\n<p>\\\nSo, all these people above made millions… sorry to say - at the expense of those who aped into $HAWK.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/sZgLpNbOPtQFz0sTBASstUpb7kG2-cl334mi.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"theiconicxspace\">The “Iconic” X Space</h2>\n<p>At some point, degens realized what happened and obviously, the accusations about the whole thing being a rug emerged. Most of their tweets got community noted to warn those who were still unaware.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/sZgLpNbOPtQFz0sTBASstUpb7kG2-724340e.png\" alt=\"\" />Of course, everyone was waiting for a reaction, response, and comms from the team.</p>\n<p>\\\nAnd they eventually got what they were waiting for - X space with Hailey and co…</p>\n<p>\\\nWhich was later deleted from their accounts…</p>\n<p>\\\nWas that because it was a complete disaster?</p>\n<p>\\\nMaybe…</p>\n<p>\\\nBut hey - we all know nothing disappears from the internet right?</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://x.com/TheTylerBueno/status/1864562868852584549\">Here is the full recording for you</a></p>\n<p>\\\nBelow is a short recap:</p>\n<p>\\\nIt started by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/DocHollywoodArt\">the “dev,”</a>&nbsp;or whoever in the team he was, who spoke for the first 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>\\\nHere are a few messages that stood out from his “speech”:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>You are not the target audience - this is not for crypto crowd but rather her fans</em></li>\n<li><em>If you guys are in crypto, you probably are mentally ill</em></li>\n<li><em>You guys should be kissing my fucking ass…</em></li>\n<li><em>Most of you, we don’t want you in the community - you’re not great people</em></li>\n<li><em>Send it to 0 couldn’t care less ….</em></li>\n<li><em>Hawk Tuah is a cultural meme - this is not a celebrity token</em></li>\n<li><em>You can go post shitty charts all day doesn’t fucking matter I don’t give a shit</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://x.com/coffeebreak_YT\">Coffeezilla</a>&nbsp;came on stage to ask questions and share his viewpoint. He was talked over and they kept muting him.</p>\n<p>\\\nSo, he left and opened&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/coffeebreak_YT/status/1864555380606431303\">his own space</a>&nbsp;called Straight Tuah Jail -</p>\n<p>\\\nFunnily enough, there is a Straight Tuah Prison (TUAH) token now out there… (don’t think it’s related to the space though:)</p>\n<p>\\\nIn short, none of the questions were addressed.</p>\n<p>\\\nThere were talks about a registered foundation in the Cayman Islands, the costs paid for the foundation being $1m (not sure for what - director salaries, legal? Was not clear), them NOT going anywhere, etc…</p>\n<p>\\\nHailey kept saying she’s just here to have fun and pretended she did not understand much about the crypto space but learning every day… The “iconic” space shut down as soon as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/chooserich\">Nick</a>&nbsp;asked how much the team was being paid because&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/chooserich/status/1864710801149329908\">Hailey interrupted mid-sentence</a>&nbsp;saying “Anywho I’m gonna go to bed I’ll see you guys tomorrow…”</p>\n<h2 id=\"aftermath\">Aftermath</h2>\n<p>Let’s see what happens tomorrow when Hawk Tuah girl wakes up …</p>\n<p>\\\nThis is not the first story… and it’s not gonna be the last either.</p>\n<p>\\\nJust like in all of those, there was a small group of people who made millions at the expense of many people who lost.</p>\n<p>\\\nNo one felt accountable.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis too will probably be forgotten.</p>\n<p>\\\nSimilar stories with the same outcome but different flavors will still be happening…</p>\n<p>\\\nSo, I guess I’ll “meet” you here when I write the next one :)</p>\n<p>\\\nP.S. Saw this after writing the article - would be a shame not to share</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/sZgLpNbOPtQFz0sTBASstUpb7kG2-nm534bz.png\" alt=\"\" />P.S.

      "content": "\"Okay, we're doing this,\" begins a new announcement at The Verge:\n\nToday we're launching a Verge subscription that lets you get rid of a bunch of ads, gets you unlimited access to our top-notch reporting and analysis across the site and our killer premium newsletters, and generally lets you support independent tech journalism in a world of sponsored influencer content. It'll cost $7 / month or $50 / year &mdash; and for a limited time, if you sign up for the annual plan, we'll send you an absolutely stunning print edition of our CONTENT GOBLINS series, with very fun new photography and design... A surprising number of you have asked us to launch something like this, and we're happy to deliver. If you don't want to pay, rest assured that big chunks of The Verge will remain free &mdash; we're thinking about subscriptions a lot differently than everyone else... \n\nIf you're a Verge reader, you know we've been covering massive, fundamental changes to how the internet works for years now. Most major social media platforms are openly hostile to links, huge changes to search have led to the death of small websites, and everything is covered in a layer of AI slop and weird scams. The algorithmic media ecosystem is now openly hostile to the kind of rigorous, independent journalism we want to do. \n\nA few years ago, we decided the only real way to survive all this was to stand apart and bet on our own website so that we could remain independent of these platforms and their algorithms. We didn't want to write stories to chase Google Search trends or because we thought they'd do well on social media. And we definitely didn't want to compromise our famously strict ethics policy to accept brand endorsement deals from the companies we cover, which almost all of our competitors in the creator economy are forced to do in order to run sustainable businesses... \n\n[W]e intend to keep making this thing together for a long, long time. So many of you like The Verge that we've actually gotten a shocking number of notes from people asking how they can pay to support our work. It's no secret that lots of great websites and publications have gone under over the past few years as the open web falls apart, and it's clear that directly supporting the creators you love is a big part of how everyone gets to stay working on the modern internet. At the same time, we didn't want to simply paywall the entire site &mdash; it's a tragedy that traditional journalism is retreating behind paywalls while nonsense spreads across platforms for free. \n\nThe print premium for subscribers is described as a \"beautiful / deranged print product\" that's drawn from a series of articles \"about what Google had done to the web, capped off by a feature about search engine optimization titled 'The People Who Ruined the Internet.'\"\nBut it ships with a satirical cover that instead proclaims it as \"The Verge Guide to Search Engine Optimization\". A tongue-in-check announcement explains:\n\n[A] year has passed, and we've had a change of heart. Maybe search engine optimization is actually a good thing. Maybe appeasing the search algorithm is not only a sustainable strategy for building a loyal audience, but also a strategic way to plan and produce content. What are journalists, if not content creators? Anyway, SEO community, consider this our apology. And what better way to say \"our bad, your industry is not a cesspool of AI slop but a brilliant vision of what a useful internet could look like\" than collecting all the things we've learned in one handy print magazine? Which is why I'm proud to introduce The Verge Guide to Search Engine Optimization: All the Tips, Tricks, Hints, Schemes, and Techniques for Promoting High-Quality Content! \t \nWhoops &mdash; slip off the cover and the real title appears: \"CONTENT GOBLINS\" (written in green slime). Again, it's \"an anthology of stories about 'content' and the people who 'make' it.\"\n\nIn very Verge fashion, we are meeting the moment where the internet has been overrun by AI garbage by publishing a beautifully designed, limited edition print product. (Also, the last time we printed a magazine, it won a very prestigious design award.) Content Goblins collects some of our best stories over the past couple years, capturing the cynical push for the world's great art and journalism to be reduced into units that can be packaged, distributed, and consumed on the internet. Consider Content Goblins as our resistance to that movement. With terrific new art and photography, we're making the case that great reporting is vital and enduring &mdash; and worth paying for. \n\nThis gorgeous, grotesque magazine can be yours if you commit to an annual subscription to The Verge &mdash; while supplies last.\n<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=The+Verge+Explains+Why%2C+After+13+Years%2C+It's+Offering+a+'Subscription'+Option+for+Its+Supporters%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F04%2F1959245%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F04%2F1959245%2Fthe-verge-explains-why-after-13-years-its-offering-a-subscription-option-for-its-supporters%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/04/1959245/the-verge-explains-why-after-13-years-its-offering-a-subscription-option-for-its-supporters?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23541687&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

      "content": "<p>After years in JavaScript's endless sea of competing packages, Elixir's ecosystem feels like a breath of fresh air. Instead of evaluating 15 different libraries for each function, Elixir typically offers one or two battle-tested solutions per problem domain. This focused approach means each tool is well-maintained, thoroughly documented, and production-proven.</p>\n<p>\\\nLet me share my favorite libraries that make Elixir development a joy, especially from the npm world of decision paralysis. Each tool solves a problem elegantly without trying to be everything to everyone, and I’m here for that. Anyone else?</p>\n<h2 id=\"thegamechangers\"><strong>The Game-Changers</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"backgroundjobsallthelovetooban\"><strong>Background Jobs: All the Love to Oban</strong></h3>\n<p>Coming from Sidekiq in Ruby and Bull in Node.js, <strong><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/oban-bg/oban\">Oban</a></strong></strong> was a revelation. It's the only job processor I've used that leverages PostgreSQL instead of requiring Redis – this architectural choice means your jobs are transactionally consistent with your data. With 3.4k GitHub stars, it's clear I'm not alone in appreciating this solution.</p>\n<p>\\\nI particularly love how it handles job persistence. When our application crashed in Node.js, we'd lose in-memory jobs. With Oban, they survive restarts because they're stored right in PostgreSQL. The recent MySQL support shows they're thinking about broader adoption too.</p>\n<h3 id=\"graphqldonerightabsinthe\"><strong>GraphQL Done Right: Absinthe</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe\">Absinthe</a></strong></strong> feels like coming home if you've wrestled with GraphQL implementations in other languages. With 4.3k GitHub stars, it's not just popular – it's the standard. What makes it special isn't just the comprehensive feature set but how naturally it integrates with Elixir's concurrency model. Field resolution can be async by default, and the <strong><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/97197/what-is-the-n1-selects-problem-in-orm-object-relational-mapping\">N+1 query problem</a></strong> just… disappears.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thedailyworkhorses\"><strong>The Daily Workhorses</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"datahandlinggodblessflop\"><strong>Data Handling: God Bless Flop</strong></h3>\n<p>Remember writing custom pagination and filtering over and over? <strong><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/woylie/flop\">Flop</a></strong></strong> ended that tedium for me. With both offset and cursor-based pagination built-in and a filtering system that makes sense, it's become my go-to for any data-heavy interface. The fact that it works seamlessly with Phoenix makes it even better – the pre-built components save hours of development time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dataencryptioncloakspracticalmagic\"><strong>Data Encryption: Cloak's Practical Magic</strong></h3>\n<p>After struggling with attr_encrypted in Ruby and TypeORM encryption in Node.js, I found exactly what I needed in <strong><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/danielberkompas/cloak\">Cloak</a></strong></strong>. What sets it apart (and earned it that 9.0/6.3 <strong><a href=\"https://elixir.libhunt.com/categories/689-cryptography\">rating on LibHunt</a></strong>) is how it makes encrypted data actually usable. You can search through encrypted fields – a feature that blew my mind when I first discovered it. The GDPR compliance support isn't just a checkbox feature; it's deeply integrated into how Cloak handles data. And when you need to rotate encryption keys (and you will), Cloak makes it painless instead of panic-inducing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multitenancytriplexismypainkiller\"><strong>Multi-tenancy: Triplex Is My Painkiller</strong></h3>\n<p>Multi-tenancy used to give me nightmares until I found <strong><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/ateliware/triplex\">Triplex</a></strong></strong>. Its use of PostgreSQL schemas for tenant isolation is brilliant – it's like each tenant gets their private database but without the operational overhead. The way it maintains the familiar Ecto query interface means you barely have to think about the multi-tenant aspect while coding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thequalityoflifeimprovers\"><strong>The Quality-of-Life Improvers</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"cachingwhycachexstandsout\"><strong>Caching: Why Cachex Stands Out</strong></h3>\n<p>After trying various caching solutions across different languages, <strong><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/whitfin/cachex\">Cachex</a></strong></strong>'s approach just clicks. For a good reason, it's the highest-rated caching solution on LibHunt (9.7/10). The combination of time-based expiration, size limits, and transaction support covers every caching scenario I've encountered. The cache warming strategies have saved us during high-traffic events multiple times.</p>\n<h3 id=\"jwthandlingjokensfocusedapproach\"><strong>JWT Handling: Joken's Focused Approach</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/joken-elixir/joken\">Joken</a></strong> is a perfect example of the Elixir ecosystem's philosophy: do one thing and do it well. It's not trying to be a complete auth solution – instead, it focuses on JWT handling and does it perfectly. The built-in security features and flexible integration options make token management a piece of cake.</p>\n<h3 id=\"httpclientreqisbatteryincluded\"><strong>HTTP Client: Req Is Battery-Included</strong></h3>\n<p>While HTTPoison <strong><a href=\"https://elixir.libhunt.com/categories/4974-http-client\">dominates the LibHunt ratings</a></strong>, I've fallen in love with <strong><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/wojtekmach/req\">Req</a></strong></strong>'s approach. Its batteries-included philosophy means I spend less time configuring and more time building. The automatic retries and response handling just work, and the pluggable architecture makes customization straightforward when needed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"awsintegrationexawsmakescloudsimple\"><strong>AWS Integration: ExAws Makes Cloud Simple</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/ex-aws/ex_aws\">ExAws</a></strong></strong> (1.3k stars) transformed my thoughts about AWS integration in Elixir. Its modular approach means you only include the services you need, keeping your dependencies lean. The consistent API patterns across different AWS services make it feel like you're working with native Elixir code rather than wrestling with AWS peculiarities.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/1fq1znkuBWaNW9Ozxi9L8O2MtfI3-3d034om.png\" alt=\"9 open-source Elixir tools to build your SaaS\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"whythismatters\"><strong>Why This Matters</strong></h2>\n<p>The beauty of Elixir's ecosystem isn't just in the individual tools but in how they work together.&nbsp; I absolutely love that I can build a complete, production-ready application using only Elixir. There's no decision fatigue, no compatibility nightmares, just solid, focused solutions that solve real problems. Coming from ecosystems where you might spend days just choosing packages, this clarity is refreshing.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhat's your experience with these tools? Have they changed how you think about building Elixir applications? I'd love to hear your stories and discoveries in the comments.</p>",

It is known that the governments of the United States, China, Germany, Ukraine, and other countries possess significant crypto holdings.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe formalisation of strategy had remained forgotten until Trump’s victory reawakened debates about using Bitcoin as a core asset for the U.S. strategic reserve. In fact, this became a more tangible concept, as the majority of Congress seats were taken by pro-crypto senators.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The Trump administration understands it, I think Senator Lummis understands it…that’s why it will happen,”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>– believes Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy executive chairman and a renowned Bitcoin maxi.</p>\n<p>\\\nNational crypto reserve is only one of the elements reflecting possible U.S. administration’s course to elaborating crypto regulation.

Among them are 62 public companies, such as Reddit and Tesla.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"solanainspotlightweb3dominanceandaiagents\">Solana in spotlight, Web3-dominance, and AI Agents</h2>\n<p>The attention to blockchain protocols has been exponentially growing since autumn.</p>\n<p>\\\nFirstly, Firedancer came into play. Dubbed as “Frankendancer”, this prototype of a validator has sent shockwaves throughout the community by managing to process over 1 million transactions per second. But crucially, it spurred the l1 token market, already heated enough ahead of a so-called altseason – a period of all-at-once surge for the altcoins.</p>\n<p>\\\nAs a result, Solana’s total value locked (TVL) is at its peak of $8 billion. Apart from technological advancements, it was also boosted thanks to memecoins popularity. According to CoinMarketCap, the ecosystem’s capitalisation has <strong><a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/view/solana-ecosystem/\">grown</a></strong> 28% since the beginning of Q4, as top Solana-based ‘memes’ capitalisation <strong><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/solana-meme-coins\">surged</a></strong> nearly 300% since July.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/y2n4tY4QzFMf0GccUNg9hyQFUR03-0p236hp.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n\\\n\\\nSolana’s enhanced position in the market paved a way north for other Web3 solutions. Layer one solution Sui has seen a record $1.5 billion TVL, as its native SUI token grew over 110% since October 1. Meanwhile, WBT – a centrepiece of the Whitechain network – has managed to secure almost 2x growth for the Q4, securing a $3 billion-sized market capitalisation.</p>\n<p>\\\nApart from L1s, artificial intelligence (AI) is slowly taking centre stage as the leading technology in the market. Specifically, with the AI agents becoming in demand.</p>\n<p>\\\nAI agents operate with goal-oriented autonomy and multi-step decision-making. This allows them to evaluate conditions dynamically, make nuanced choices, and engage in economic and social interactions across on-chain and off-chain platforms.</p>\n<p>\\\nAccording to Blockhead, this flexibility <strong><a href=\"https://www.blockhead.co/2024/11/16/ai-managed-fund-ai16z-takes-crypto-by-storm-hits-200m-market-cap-2/\">makes</a></strong> AI agents particularly suited for crypto, a space that demands agility and rapid decision-making due to its inherent volatility and decentralized nature.</p>\n<p>\\n Such shift is underscored by the success stories of AI agents like Terminal of Truths and the explosive growth of the memecoins $GOAT and Centience ($CENTS), and now, an AI-powered VC – ai16z. The latter one scored 694% in only a week.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"lastfomcmeetingof2024andaltseason\">Last FOMC Meeting of 2024 and Altseason</h2>\n<p>Market expectations are high as never before – perhaps, just like the importance of the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) December meeting. One will not only reveal the interest rates, but set the course for next year’s macroeconomy and hence crypto market.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/y2n4tY4QzFMf0GccUNg9hyQFUR03-fi036rn.jpeg\" alt=\"Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference at the end of the two-day FOMC meeting on March 20, 2024. Source: CNN\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThe outlooks are generally positive, as since the initial September historic cut by 50 basis points (bps), the rates were diminished by 20 bps again in November. Such a tendency has been bringing a sequential liquidity flow into the global cryptocurrency market, while the potential impact from December cuts may be even more pronounced.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis influx of capital, which the last FOMC meeting of 2024 may bring, coupled with a more favourable macroeconomic environment, could ignite a bullish wave, positioning 2025 as a year of resurgence.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf the FOMC signals a pivot toward easing monetary policy, it might catalyse renewed confidence in crypto markets, unlocking dormant capital and fueling a rally akin to the prior economic expansions. The December meeting thus becomes not just a pivotal moment for traditional markets but a harbinger for crypto’s next big leap.</p>\n<p>\\\nMost importantly, the expectations remain positive, as the majority of investors expect a 25 bps cut in December.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/y2n4tY4QzFMf0GccUNg9hyQFUR03-zg1369v.jpeg\" alt=\"Target rate probabilities for December FOMC meeting.

      "content": "The use of lead in gasoline \"might have harmed the mental health of a generation,\" reports USA Today.\n\n\nGen X bears an extra burden of conditions such as depression, anxiety, ADHD and neurotic behavior because of the leaded gasoline they were exposed to as children, according to a study published Wednesday in the peer-reviewed Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry. Leaded gas was banned in the United States in 1996, but the study said years of exposure during development made them particularly vulnerable. \n\nLead gas peaked from the mid-1960s through the mid-1970s, and children born during that era would later develop some of the highest rates of mental health symptoms, the study said. The study also linked leaded gas to \"disadvantageous\" traits, such as struggling to concentrate, stay on task or organizing thoughts. \"I tend to think of Generation X as 'generation lead,'\" said Aaron Reuben, a study co-author and assistant professor of clinical neuropsychology at the University of Virginia. \"We know they were exposed to it more and we're estimating they have gone on to have higher rates of internalizing conditions like anxiety, depression and symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder....\" \n\nResearchers linked the lead exposure to an estimated 151 million \"excess mental disorders\" in the United States over the 75-year period. The estimates should be \"considered a floor\" because it relies mainly on gas and not exposure from lead in paint and pipes, Reuben said... Those born between 1966 and 1986 generally had higher mental illness levels linked to lead exposure with the rates peaking for those born between 1966 and 1970, the study said. Those rates coincided with the peak use of lead in gas from the mid-1960s through the mid-1970s... The study said the peak lead use coincided with increased demand for psychiatric care and higher rates of juvenile delinquency.\n \n Today there's routine blood screenings for high levels of lead, study co-author Reuben says.

The company's innovative approach analyzes user’s blockchain activity to deliver hyper-targeted advertisements while prioritizing user privacy and data protection. Today, Slise ads reach <strong>more than 6 million active crypto-users</strong> and count the largest brands in the space including <strong>PayPal, MetaMask, Revolut</strong>, and <strong>OKX</strong> among its clients.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/GA37V9HtdQeZRkvZVKt8pteCVhD2-sq136vf.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThis acquisition marks a significant step forward for W3M Ventures as it continues to expand its vision for decentralized advertising technology. The company has interests in various Web3 and crypto adtech platforms including <strong>AADS</strong>, the oldest traditional ad network in the crypto space.</p>\n<p>\\\n\"==<em>The acquisition of Slise represents a pivotal moment in our journey to revolutionize digital advertising for the Web3 era</em>==<em>,</em>\" the spokesperson for W3M Ventures said. \"<em>Their groundbreaking technology aligns perfectly with our vision of creating <strong>more effective, privacy-centric advertising solutions for the decentralized web.</strong></em>\"</p>\n<p>\\\nOleksii Sidorov, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Slise, added, \"<strong><em>W3M Ventures is the perfect catalyst for Slise’s growth</em></strong> <em>as they have experience and resources to accelerate the adoption of onchain data in digital advertising space for <strong>a more fair and transparent future</strong>. The team and I couldn’t be more excited to make our contribution to this change.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\\\nReflecting on the journey, Oleksii shares insights into the growth and development of the company during crypto-winter:</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>“The beginning of Slise coincided with the collapse of Luna and later FTX which initiated a downturn of the crypto market. Economically, it didn’t make any sense, only our belief in the potential of onchain data for ads pushed us forward.</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>It wasn't a smooth journey, very few VCs shared our beliefs. Slise didn’t close huge rounds despite later having 6-digit revenue, neither did we receive countless grants, we were underdogs, surviving, while our token-first competitors raised tens of millions before even having a product.</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>I don’t think the crypto market incentivizes building good products. Only independent thinking from first principles took us where we are now. We’ve never sponsored a side event or entertained people on X, instead, we stayed frugal and focused on client acquisition and operational efficiency. This all helped us build a business value and a dominant market position which W3M Ventures acquires today.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n==The integration of Slise into Web3 Media Ventures' portfolio is expected to be completed within the next quarter. Clients and partners can anticipate new, enhanced advertising experiences in the coming months. The Slise team will help transition the <a href=\"https://slise.xyz\">Slise.xyz</a> business under W3M Ventures management while the core personnel will continue working on its new non-competing product <a href=\"https://dise.app\">Dise.app</a> — an AI-powered Sales CRM for crypto teams on Telegram.==</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"aboutweb3mediaventures\">About Web3 Media Ventures</h3>\n<p><strong>Web3 Media Ventures</strong> is an investment firm with equity and digital asset holdings in Web3 and adtech platforms.

      "content": "<p>In this article, I will show you how you can test a restful “Get” method using the Robot Framework. If you are new to Robot Framework, please read the <a href=\"https://robotframework.org/\">doc</a> from the website to find out the setup guide. You can install Robot Framework using “pip install robotframework” in your command line. Please note that you must install pip on your system before running this command.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo write test cases in Robot Framework, you should create a file with .robot extension, then you can write your scenario in the file to be run.</p>\n<p>\\\nEach .robot file usually contains three main parts: Settings, Variables, and Test cases like the below image.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-dk034nd.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nIn settings, you can import the libraries, suit setup, and documentation. In the variables part, you can put your variables, and the scenarios are written in the test cases section.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo test a simple Get request, we should import “RequestsLibrary” in settings because we want to make a request. In test cases, first, we should define a keyword for our test scenario, and then we should write the test steps in the keyword’s scope. See the picture below:</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-ca234r3.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nLet’s automate a simple Get request together.</p>\n<p>\\\nSuppose we want to write a test case for the following curl. This test case will call the endpoint and assert whether:</p>\n<pre><code>1- The endpoint responds with 200.\n\n2- The response body contains “Google“ word.\n\n3- The value of Content-Type is “application/json” in response headers.\n</code></pre>\n<p>curl --location 'https://api.restful-api.dev/objects' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data ''</p>\n<p>\\\nThis is a simple request that returns some mobile names like the below picture:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/hSvanXy1MWOhRExFqw9MXJbKuTD3-b9135kf.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nIn this step, I am going to write a Robot Framework code to call the API and assert the response.</p>\n<p>\\\nFirst, I define a variable to hold the base address of the API. Second, I put the URI of the API in another variable. You may ask why I put the URI in another variable. You will get your answer in the creating get request step.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/hSvanXy1MWOhRExFqw9MXJbKuTD3-v4035p1.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nAs I mentioned earlier, it it important to choose a name for our keyword. I choose get_request for the keyword part and then write the codes in the keyword’s scope. To create a restful request, we should establish a session first. Robot Framework has a built-in function to establish a session, it is “Create Session”:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">Create Session    session_name    ${base_address}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nThen we can make a get request by using “Get Request“ built-in function:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">Get Request    session_name      ${uri}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nGet Request is a built-in function in Robot Framework that gets at least two arguments. This is why I put the URI in a separate variable. The code above calls the API and gets the response, so we must hold the response in a variable like:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">${resp}=    Get Request    session_name     ${uri}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nGoing through the steps that I have mentioned so far, will make get request, call the API, and save the response in the “resp” variable. Now we have the response and are ready to do assertions. One of the assertions in Robot Framework is “Should Be Equal“ built-in function. It gets two arguments and compares them. If they are the same, the assertion will return true.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">Should Be Equal    ${resp.status_code}    200\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nNote that integers in Robot Framework are considered as strings and ${resp.status<em>code} is returned as an integer. For example, in the code line above, 200 is an integer but Robot Framework considers it as a string so you should convert ${resp.status</em>code} to a string to compare it with 200. The built-in function for converting an integer to a string is “Convert To String“.</p>\n<p>\\\nThrough the response of the API, we can get the response headers and response body by ${resp.headers} and ${resp.content} respectively. Once you have the body of the response and the headers of the response, you can assert them as well. For instance, suppose you want to check whether the response body contains a specific word “x“. It is possible to make this assertion by using a built-in function “Should Contain“.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">Should Contain    ${resp.content}    x\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nPlease note that ${resp.content} is the body of the response in bytes, so you should convert the word “x“ to byte to do the assertion. The built-in function for converting to byte is “Convert To Bytes“.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo assert the headers, we should capture all headers from the response. ${resp.headers} will capture all response headers as a dictionary. As a result, to assert a specific value, we should get the value from the headers dictionary by using the key(we know that the dictionary holds keys and the related values; we can access any value by the related key). This can be done by “Get From Dictionary“ built-in function.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">${content_type_value}=    Get From Dictionary     ${resp.headers}     Content-Type\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nNow we have the value of Content-Type header and we can assert it.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">Should Be Equal    ${content_type_value}    application/json\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nIn the picture below, you can see all the assertions at a glance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/hSvanXy1MWOhRExFqw9MXJbKuTD3-bc235q1.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nResources:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://restful-api.dev/\">https://restful-api.dev/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://robotframework.org/\">https://robotframework.org/</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Image header: by <a href=\"https://www.freepik.com/author/brgfx\">brgfx</a> on freepik</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\\</p>",

      "content": "<p>The goal of this article is to provide information to developers who are considering microservice integration using Event Driven Architecture and Messaging.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"context\"><strong>Context</strong></h2>\n<p>In a monolithic application, software components invoke one another using language-level methods or function calls, and the objects are typically running within the same process on the same server.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn a microservices architecture, components are distributed and can be run on multiple processes across multiple servers. They communicate with one another across a network using an&nbsp;<strong><em>inter-service communications protocol</em></strong>. There are several factors to consider when selecting an inter-service protocol. Messaging is one that can provide many advantages, but it's not always appropriate for every App.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"interservicecommunicationtypes\">Inter-Service Communication Types</h2>\n<p>The selection of an inter-service communication protocol should be made with consideration of the service's goals and use cases. They are classified as either synchronous or asynchronous and by the number of receivers (single or multiple).</p>\n<h3 id=\"synchronousorasynchronous\">Synchronous or Asynchronous</h3>\n<p>The first distinction between inter-service communication protocol types is whether they are synchronous or asynchronous.</p>\n<h3 id=\"synchronous\">Synchronous</h3>\n<p>In synchronous communication, the client sends a request and waits for a response from the service. The client code can only continue its task after it receives the server response. The protocol (HTTP/HTTPS) is synchronous.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf possible, avoid depending on synchronous communication (request/response) between multiple microservices, including for queries. Having HTTP dependencies between microservices not only makes your microservices not autonomous but also their performance is impacted if one of the services in the chain is impaired.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/Ba98HYkpvbZRfwP0E9wiyYfxvG82-2k034l2.jpeg\" alt=\"Synchronous \" /></p>\n<p>\\\nIt's considered an anti-pattern when a \"chain\" of HTTP requests is created between microservices while serving a client request. This causes the client response to be delayed and dependent on the performance of all microservices in the chain. A better implementation would be to use asynchronous communication using Messaging in which the client request is served right away.</p>\n<h3 id=\"asynchronous\">Asynchronous</h3>\n<p>In asynchronous message communication, the client or message sender usually doesn't wait for a response. It just sends the message to a message queue or message broker. This enforces a microservice's autonomy.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/Ba98HYkpvbZRfwP0E9wiyYfxvG82-fb134sz.jpeg\" alt=\"Asynchronous\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AMQP</strong>&nbsp;- The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol has been developed to provide a platform-agnostic method to ensure messages can be easily exchanged between services. Most of the major messaging systems have adopted this standard.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"numberofreceivers\">Number of Receivers</h3>\n<p>The second distinction between inter-service communication protocol types is if they are communicating to a single receiver or multiple.</p>\n<h4 id=\"singlereceivers\">Single Receivers</h4>\n<p>In a Single Receiver design each request must be processed by exactly one receiver or service. An example of this communication is the Command pattern.</p>\n<h4 id=\"multiplereceivers\">Multiple Receivers</h4>\n<p>In a Multiple Receiver design, each request can be processed by zero to multiple receivers. This type of communication must be asynchronous. An example is the publish/subscribe mechanism used in patterns like Event-driven architecture. This is based on an event-bus interface or message broker when propagating data updates between multiple microservices through events; it's usually implemented through a service bus or message broker by using topics and subscriptions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"combiningcommunicationmethods\">Combining Communication Methods</h3>\n<p>A microservice-based application will often use a combination of these communication methods. The most common type is single-receiver communication with a synchronous protocol like HTTP/HTTPS when invoking a regular Web API HTTP service. Microservices however, typically use messaging protocols for asynchronous communication between microservices.</p>\n<h3 id=\"eventdrivenmicroservicearchitecture\">Event-Driven Microservice Architecture</h3>\n<p>Events are records of something that has happened, a change in state. They are immutable (they cannot be changed or deleted), and they are ordered in the sequence of their creation.</p>\n<p>\\\nEvent-driven architecture refers to a system of loosely coupled microservices that exchange information between each other through the production and consumption of events. Interested systems can be notified of these state changes by subscribing to published events and then acting on the information using their business logic. This is referred to as the Pub Sub Pattern.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The main benefits of event-driven systems are&nbsp;asynchronous&nbsp;behavior and&nbsp;loosely coupled&nbsp;structures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\\\nBenefits of the Event-Driven Microservice Architecture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Loosely coupled structure</li>\n<li>Asynchronous event-driven functionality</li>\n<li>Isolation of the microservices</li>\n<li>No synchronous REST calls</li>\n<li>Performance</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"eventsanddomaindrivendesign\">Events and Domain-Driven Design</h3>\n<p>In the Domain-driven design (DDD) approach to software development, the business domain is carefully modeled in software and evolved over time, independently of the infrastructure that makes the system work. DDD is used to define the different bounded contexts that represent the various business processes that the application needs to perform.</p>\n<p>\\\nThese contexts are then joined together with events, creating a unidirectional dependency graph that decouples each bounded context from those that arise downstream, to create rich event-streaming business applications.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"messagingsystems\">Messaging Systems</h2>\n<p><strong>Enterprise Application Integration (EAI)</strong>&nbsp;is the implementation of technologies that facilitate communication between enterprise applications and microservices. EAI establishes a middleware framework that helps data flow freely between services without significant changes to the applications themselves.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Enterprise Messaging Systems (EMS)</strong>&nbsp;are the Middleware that facilitates the exchange of messages between microservices. Referred to as&nbsp;<strong>Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM)</strong>, it's the infrastructure supporting sending and receiving messages between distributed services.</p>\n<h3 id=\"messagingarchitectures\">Messaging Architectures</h3>\n<p>EAI architecture is made up of the following components.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Producer</strong>&nbsp;- Entity which creates the event (also known as the&nbsp;<strong>Publisher</strong>).</li>\n<li><strong>Consumer</strong>&nbsp;- Entity which consumes the event (also known as the&nbsp;<strong>Subscriber</strong>).</li>\n<li><strong>Topic</strong>&nbsp;- Category name to which messages are published and stored.</li>\n<li><strong>Endpoint</strong>&nbsp;- The network point at which consuming entity is connected to the MOM.</li>\n<li><strong>Broker</strong>&nbsp;- Single central controller which contains the MOM logic.</li>\n<li><strong>Bus</strong>&nbsp;- Architecture where the endpoints contain the logic rather than a single entity.</li>\n<li><strong>Routing</strong>&nbsp;- Sending the message to the interested parties.</li>\n<li><strong>Transformation</strong>&nbsp;- Modifying the message so that it can be understood by a subscriber.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"messagebrokervsmessagebus\">Message Broker vs Message Bus</h3>\n<p>Messaging systems have two primary architecture designs, Message Broker and Message Bus. The Message Bus architecture is an advanced way of implementing EAI.</p>\n<h3 id=\"messagebrokerarchitecture\">Message Broker Architecture</h3>\n<p>The first inter-service communications solutions incorporated all the functionality required for integration into a central hub called the \"broker\". A key point in this model is the&nbsp;<strong><em>broker contains the logic</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn a broker approach, a central piece of software (the \"message broker\") resides in the middle of the network, and provides all message transformation, routing, and any other inter-application functionality. All communication between applications must flow through the hub, allowing the hub to maintain data concurrency for the entire network. It's referred to as a&nbsp;<strong>hub-and-spoke</strong>&nbsp;architecture.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/Ba98HYkpvbZRfwP0E9wiyYfxvG82-n32341p.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"brokeradvantages\">Broker Advantages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Direct Communication</strong>&nbsp;- creates a direct information pipeline between the event generator and the interested parties. Communications involve only the sender, broker, and the designated receivers. As a state change occurs, those parties can almost immediately know that it happened.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Complex functions</strong>&nbsp;- can be achieved with chained Event Brokers. For example, by using a log-based Event Broker, events can be \"replayed\" as part of a historical log.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Broker Disadvantages</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No Single Source of Truth&nbsp;- Because the logic is part of the broker, the endpoints do not have a way to resolve conflicting events.</li>\n<li>Scaling&nbsp;- Does not scale well for complex functions.</li>\n<li>Reliability&nbsp;- The broker can become a single point of failure for the network because it's responsible for all concurrency between the application's data sets and states, all messages between applicants must pass through it. Under heavy load, the broker can become a bottleneck for messages. A single central destination for all messages also makes it difficult to use the broker model successfully across large geographical distances.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"messagebusarchitecture\">Message Bus Architecture</h3>\n<p>Bus architecture represents an evolution of the broker hub-and-spoke model. It uses a defined set of standards to govern the flow of data between applications and implies a common protocol spoken and understood by all participants.</p>\n<p>\\\nA Message Bus architecture is where the&nbsp;<strong><em>endpoints contain the logic</em></strong>&nbsp;instead of the Broker (or Bus in this case). The Apps use a shared (common) set of interfaces and are responsible for preparing the message, so it complies with the type of messages the rest of the apps connected to the bus expect.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/Ba98HYkpvbZRfwP0E9wiyYfxvG82-kw334us.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"enterpriseservicebus\">Enterprise Service Bus</h3>\n<p>The term Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) refers to a communication bus between different applications. Each application is enabled to talk to the bus, which in turn allows the sharing of data and communications between the connected applications.</p>\n<p>:::tip\n<strong>Tip</strong>: The terms Broker and Bus are often used interchangeably and there are many interpretations.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<h4 id=\"busadvantages\">Bus Advantages</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Allows more ubiquitous access to events and data.</li>\n<li>Producers and consumers don’t need to have knowledge of one another.</li>\n<li>New services can start consuming messages immediately without producer changes.</li>\n<li>Service discovery is easily achieved by sending messages to the right topics.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nThanks &amp; Happy Reading!</p>\n<p>\\</p>",

      "content": "<p>\\\nImagine you’re building a house. You have the structure — walls and a roof — but what’s the first thing you need to make it usable? Correct! Utilities — water, electricity, gas. Without them, the house is just an empty shell. Building and maintaining the plumbing to ensure everything flows smoothly is essential to making a house functional. This is the perfect analogy for the role of a data engineer.</p>\n<p>\\\nI have some experience in data engineering through my years as a data analyst. Continuing the analogy, if data engineers are responsible for building and maintaining the utilities, data analysts are like the people who decide how to use them effectively — setting up smart thermostats, monitoring energy consumption, or planning renovations. Throughout my journey, I collaborated with data engineers and gained a high-level understanding of their responsibilities. Without their work, analysts like me would be stuck waiting for “water” (data) to arrive. Thanks to data engineers, I always had access to structured and up-to-date data.</p>\n<p>\\\nNow, I’d like to take you through a basic learning project to dive into this domain a little deeper.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Disclaimer</strong>: In some organizations, especially smaller ones, the roles of data engineers and analysts may overlap.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/zSst8qrTnweskk17xoEFjSbudOJ2-e7035ae.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h1 id=\"theproblem\">The Problem</h1>\n<p>Imagine you’re a junior data engineer working for an e-scooter service company. One of your tasks is to collect data from external sources, such as weather and flight information. You might wonder, “Why is this data even necessary?” Here’s why:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When it rains, the demand for e-scooters drops significantly.</li>\n<li>Tourists often prefer using e-scooters to explore cities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nBy analyzing patterns like these, weather and flight data can help predict usage trends and optimize the distribution of e-scooters. For example, if rain is forecasted in one area, or a large wave of tourists is expected due to flight arrivals, the company can proactively manage scooter locations to meet changing demand.</p>\n<p>\\\nYour goal is to ensure this data is well-organized, updated daily, and easily accessible from a database.Let’s dive into the process of extracting, transforming, and loading this data.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/zSst8qrTnweskk17xoEFjSbudOJ2-r5135e6.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h1 id=\"dataextraction\">Data Extraction</h1>\n<p>To extract external data (or “water”), there are two common approaches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pump from a river: <strong>Web scraping</strong>.</li>\n<li>Connect to a central water supply: <strong>APIs</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nIn this project, I used both methods.</p>\n<h2 id=\"webscraping\">Web Scraping</h2>\n<p>Web scraping involves extracting data directly from web pages. I scraped Wikipedia for city information, such as population and coordinates, using Python libraries like <code>requests</code> and <code>BeautifulSoup</code>. Here’s how it works:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Requests</strong>: Fetches the HTML content of a web page.</li>\n<li><strong>BeautifulSoup</strong>: Parses the HTML to extract specific elements, like population or latitude.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\n<strong>HTML</strong> (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language for structuring web pages. Data like population is often located within HTML elements like <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/zSst8qrTnweskk17xoEFjSbudOJ2-s9235z8.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nWhile scraping can be useful, it’s often inefficient and unreliable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some websites use JavaScript to load content dynamically, making it harder to extract.</li>\n<li>Others block scraping attempts using security mechanisms like CAPTCHA.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"apis\">APIs</h2>\n<p>In the previous step, we retrieved the longitude and latitude for the cities where the company operates. This data is crucial for making requests to APIs, which are designed to provide structured and reliable data access. Let me explain:</p>\n<p>\\\nAn <strong>API (Application Programming Interface)</strong> is a tool that allows computers or programs to communicate with each other. For instance, I used the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time weather data and the Aerodatabox API for airport and flight details.</p>\n<p>\\\nHowever, just like accessing a central water supply, using an API often comes with a cost. OpenWeather offers a limited number of free daily requests, while Aerodatabox requires a subscription for extended use. Additionally, APIs use an <strong>API Key</strong> — a unique code that authenticates requests to ensure that only authorized users can access the service.</p>\n<p>\\\nOf course, many APIs can work directly with city names instead of requiring latitude and longitude. However, it’s valuable to explore multiple approaches and understand how geographic coordinates are used, isn’t it?</p>\n<p>\\\nBy making polite requests to the API with our location data, we receive structured responses, like weather forecasts or flight information, ready for analysis.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/zSst8qrTnweskk17xoEFjSbudOJ2-nl335td.jpeg\" alt=\"This data looks well-structured and convenient for extraction.\" /></p>\n<h1 id=\"datatransformation\">Data Transformation</h1>\n<p>The next step in ETL is <strong>Transformation</strong> — cleaning and organizing raw data into a usable format.</p>\n<p>Common tasks include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Removing unnecessary columns.</li>\n<li>Formatting data for consistency.</li>\n<li>Handling missing values.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nThe most interesting transformation in my project was converting latitude/longitude data from DMS format (e.g., <code>52°31′12″N</code>) to decimal format (e.g., <code>52.52000</code>). This made the data compatible with APIs. I wrote a Python function to handle this conversion. In simple terms, it’s like attaching a filter to your tap to get cleaner, better-tasting water.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/zSst8qrTnweskk17xoEFjSbudOJ2-zp435cd.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h1 id=\"dataloading\">Data Loading</h1>\n<p>The final step is <strong>Loading</strong> the cleaned data into a relational database for easy access and analysis.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Why not use Excel or CSV files?</strong></p>\n<p>Excel is like having a separate water container for every tap, washing machine, and shower — sufficient for small needs but disconnected and inefficient as your system grows. MySQL, on the other hand, is like a modern plumbing system that delivers water to every part of the house seamlessly and reliably. It’s scalable, efficient, and keeps everything linked together.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn this project, I used a MySQL database with tables for cities, population, weather, airports, and flights. After defining the schema and relationships between tables using SQL, I wrote Python functions to insert data using <code>SQLAlchemy</code> and <code>pandas</code>. Now, the database snapshot looks well-organized and ready for use.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/zSst8qrTnweskk17xoEFjSbudOJ2-9l535w8.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h1 id=\"automation\">Automation</h1>\n<p>So far, I’ve executed the pipeline manually using Python, collecting all the necessary data into the database. Again, it is a significant piece of programming code that executes sequentially and performs various operations, such as creating a connection, retrieving data, or pushing a table to an SQL database.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Key Pipeline Function</strong>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">def extracting_and_loading_data(list_of_cities):\n   connection_string = create_connection_string()\n   cities_df = get_cities_data(list_of_cities)\n   cities_to_db = transform_cities_df(cities_df)\n   push_unique_data_to_db(cities_to_db, 'cities', connection_string)\n   cities_from_sql = extract_from_db('cities', connection_string)\n   population_to_db = transform_population(cities_df, cities_from_sql)\n   push_unique_data_to_db(population_to_db, 'population', connection_string)\n   weather_df = get_weather_data(cities_from_sql)\n   push_data_to_db(weather_df, 'weather', connection_string)\n   airports_df = get_airports_data(cities_from_sql)\n   airports_to_db = transform_airports_df(airports_df)\n   push_unique_data_to_db(airports_to_db, 'airports', connection_string)\n   airports_from_sql = extract_from_db('airports', connection_string)\n   flights_df = get_flights_data(airports_from_sql)\n   push_data_to_db(flights_df, 'flights', connection_string)\n   return \"Data has been updated\"\nextracting_and_loading_data([\"Berlin\", \"Hamburg\", \"Munich\", \"Cologne\", \"Stuttgart\", \"Leipzig\", \"Dortmund\", \"Vienna\"])\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nBut automation is essential for maintaining up-to-date data. While some information (e.g., city population) rarely changes, weather and flight data need regular updates. To automate the pipeline:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Scheduling</strong>: Use a job scheduler (e.g., <code>cron</code>) to run the Python script daily.</li>\n<li><strong>Notifications</strong>: Send alerts via Slack, Telegram or email if the pipeline succeeds or fails.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\nOnce these steps are complete, monitoring the system and fixing issues as they arise will ensure the process remains smooth.</p>\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1>\n<p>This project showcases the foundational role of a data engineer in building a reliable data pipeline, much like setting up the plumbing in a house. From extracting data through web scraping and APIs to transforming it into usable formats, and finally loading it into a relational database, each step ensures that the “utilities” (data) flow smoothly for analysts and decision-makers.</p>\n<p>\\\nWe explored how to collect weather and flight data to help an e-scooter company predict usage patterns and respond to challenges like weather changes or tourist activity. The pipeline automates these processes, ensuring the data is updated daily and accessible to everyone in the company.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis isn’t the end of the journey — it’s the beginning. The groundwork laid by data engineers allows data analysts and scientists to dive deeper, uncover insights, and build predictive models. Together, these roles drive data-driven decision-making.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf you’re curious about the technical details or want to explore the code behind this project, feel free to visit my GitHub repository <a href=\"https://github.com/darigain/local_etl_pipeline\">here</a>.

The total supply of MOZ tokens is 10 billion, with 66% allocated to the community, ecosystem, nodes, and miners. The initial circulating supply is approximately 11%. The token distribution is as follows: 25% to the zkProver network, 25% to zkVerifier nodes, 16% to early contributors, 18% to early investors, 10% to the ecosystem, and 6% to the community. MOZ tokens will be gradually unlocked over the next 10 years, after which the entire supply will be in circulation, with no additional issuance.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/Wls6TtjOLGMbl8aKwQlIbcyfjQF2-t113z8r.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>More info：https://x.com/LumozOrg/status/1864688725273530507</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"potentialparticipationopportunities\">Potential Participation Opportunities</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>esMOZ Airdrop Query</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nOn November 5, Lumoz officially announced the esMOZ airdrop event. The esMOZ airdrop accounts for 10% of the total supply, valued at over $30 million based on a $300 million valuation. The airdrop covers Lumoz node holders, early Lumoz participants, users in the Ethereum and Move ecosystems, including Layer 2 solutions such as Aptos and SUI, PoW testnet participants, as well as users from the Lumoz ecosystem chains like Merlin Chain, ZKFair, Ultiverse, and Matr1x.

Currently, the official platform supports multiple channels for users to obtain NFTs for free.</p>\n<p>\\\nLumoz OG NFT acquisition portal: <a href=\"https://lumoz.org/og-nft\">https://lumoz.org/og-nft</a></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lumoz zkVerifier Node Public Sale</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nThe zkVerifier node, as an essential component of the Lumoz network's verification layer, greatly facilitates ordinary users' participation in the Zero-Knowledge (ZK) computation network while also bearing the critical responsibility of maintaining the security of network data. Lumoz launched node sales six months ago, and node holders are eligible for various rewards, including 25% of Lumoz Tokens, potential incentives from over 20 ecosystem L2s, esMOZ airdrops, Lumoz OG NFTs, and more. Currently, 80% of the nodes have been sold, and the public sales and KOL node incentive programs are still open.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf you're interested, you can click here: <a href=\"https://node.lumoz.org/\">https://node.lumoz.org/</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"conversionbetweenesmozandmoz\">Conversion Between esMOZ and MOZ</h2>\n<p>Lumoz employs a dual-token economic model, consisting of the functional token MOZ and the incentive token esMOZ. MOZ is primarily used for transaction gas fees, resource usage, and similar purposes, while esMOZ can be used for staking rewards, delegating zkVerifier nodes, and converting into MOZ. Both tokens are integral to the Lumoz protocol. After the mainnet launch, esMOZ can be converted into MOZ under specific conditions. The conversion ratio is 1:1, and conversions typically require a vesting period. However, users can bypass the lock-up period by using Lumoz OG NFTs for conversion. Upon completion of the conversion, one token is burned, and its corresponding token is minted. If a user converts esMOZ using an OG NFT, the OG NFT will also be destroyed after the conversion is completed.</p>\n<p>\\\nFor more information on obtaining Lumoz OG NFTs, visit: <a href=\"https://lumoz.org/airdrop\">https://lumoz.org/airdrop</a>.</p>\n<p>\\\nFor users who do not use OG NFTs, the following standard conversion rules apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shortest conversion period: 30 days, with a conversion ratio of 1:0.25 (25%). The remaining 75% of esMOZ will be burned during conversion.</li>\n<li>Medium conversion period: 90 days, with a conversion ratio of 1:0.5 (50%). The remaining 50% of esMOZ will be burned during conversion.</li>\n<li>Longest conversion period: 180 days, with a conversion ratio of 1:1 (100%).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>\n<p>What is past is prologue. Currently, Lumoz is in the final stages of preparation, and we hope everyone can seize this last opportunity to become a part of the Lumoz ecosystem. This is not just an investment in the future, but also the best choice to participate in the revolution of cryptocurrency technology.</p>\n<p>\\\nFor those familiar with Lumoz, you’ll know that we upgraded from the Opside brand to Lumoz. The name Lumoz comes from the Latin word \"Lumos,\" meaning \"light\" or \"brightness.\" It is referenced in J.K. Rowling's bestselling <em>Harry Potter</em> series, where \"Lumos\" is a spell used to light the tip of a magic wand and create light. By replacing the \"s\" with \"z,\" \"Lumoz\" cleverly associates itself with \"zk\" (Zero-Knowledge Proof) technology. With the mainnet launch and TGE approaching, we sincerely hope Lumoz will become a beacon of light for the ZK track, illuminating the path for the widespread adoption of ZK-Rollups.</p>\n<p>\\\nNow, let us witness this miracle together!</p>",

It's all great fun.\"\n\n[E]very single person who drives the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N, whether they're a die-hard EV person or the most hardcore electro-skeptic, absolutely loves it. And they love the fake shifting most of all... Shut up and embrace the fake EV shifting, you nerds. Find some joy in your life for once. \n\nAnd joy will definitely be on order with the new 2025 Kia EV6 GT. The U.S.-spec version of Kia's updated crossover made its debut [November 21] at the L.A. Auto Show. And while there's still a lot we don't know about it, we have power specs and one key detail: the EV6 GT now gets a simulated gear shift feature. \"The GT's new Virtual Gear Shift feature enhances driving immersion by simulating gear shifts with visuals, engine sound effects, and a tactile sensation through motor torque adjustments,\" Kia officials said in a news release. \n\n\nThe Verge points out that Hyundai's Ioniq 5 N even uses speakers &mdash; both inside the car and outside &mdash; to broadcast the sounds of ignition, a boosted EV sound, and a third sound which \"sounds like a robotic version of a fighter jet.\"\nPaired with the seemingly endless power and torque offered by the electric motors, I couldn't stop grinning. It's just like a little kid making car noises as they push a Hot Wheels car around a track, but combined with the driving experience in the Ioniq 5 N, it just taps into a pure enthusiast joy. Even kids around my neighborhood stopped and looked when I started the Ioniq 5 N up with the sound management turned on. They'd pull out their phones to take photos and videos as I drove off, happily faking the internal combustion engine experience and knowing I wasn't adding a drop of carbon to the atmosphere. \n\nThe Ioniq 5 N just might be the performance EV that will change self-described \"auto enthusiast\" minds about the electric transition. It's that good.\n<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Do+Electric+Cars+Offer+'Fake+Shifting%2C+Real+Fun'%3F%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F04%2F0527208%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F04%2F0527208%2Fdo-electric-cars-offer-fake-shifting-real-fun%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/12/04/0527208/do-electric-cars-offer-fake-shifting-real-fun?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23540979&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

Interactive fiction, for instance, is an interesting way of storytelling where you, as the reader or player, get to make choices that affect how the story unfolds. It’s often like a mix between a book and a game. By using a specific type of software, writers create these branching storylines and design different paths and outcomes based on the reader’s decisions.</p>\n<p>\\\nDepending on the software and the potential outcomes, writers don’t even need a huge amount of technical knowledge. Plus: they don’t need to pay for anything, because there are several open-source and free tools to do this, available to everyone. If you enjoy them as a reader or decide to use them as a writer, remember that you can always contribute to their creators via Kivach.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong><strong><a href=\"https://kivach.org/\">Kivach</a></strong> is an Obyte-based platform that enables users to make crypto donations to open-source projects on GitHub that can be automatically redistributed to multiple similar projects</strong> —if the recipients decide to do so. This time, we’re going to explore some interactive fiction (and related) software that is available for free and could benefit from your donations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"twine\">Twine</h2>\n<p>Have you seen/played “Black Mirror: Bandersnatch” on Netflix? Well, it was partly made with Twine, without coding. This is a free tool created by Chris Klimas, first released in 2009. It’s designed to help users build interactive, nonlinear stories without needing to know how to code. Twine is especially popular for creating text-based games and branching narratives, allowing authors to create stories that change based on the reader's choices.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/AO3i53agltRgq8NH0cq0AaViIh42-2024-12-06T13:00:12.180Z-du2e745tvl91gybdpytmjj6n\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>One of Twine’s key features is its user-friendly interface, which visually maps out how different story parts are connected.</strong> You can start with simple text, and if you want to expand your story later, <strong><a href=\"https://twinery.org/\">Twine</a></strong> supports adding variables, conditional logic, and custom styling through CSS or JavaScript. This means creators have a lot of room for creativity, with Twine allowing them to publish their work directly to HTML, making it accessible on the web.</p>\n<p>\\\nTwine is primarily supported through donations, with Chris Klimas receiving funding via Patreon and donations made to the Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation. Of course, you can also <strong><a href=\"https://kivach.org/repo/klembot/twinejs\">donate them some coins via Kivach</a></strong>, even directly to the authors. Other notable works made with Twine include Howling Dogs (2012) and Depression Quest (2013), as well as stories like Chloe Is Home (2022) and I Gave You a Key and You Opened the Darkness (2023).</p>\n<h2 id=\"renpy\">Ren’Py</h2>\n<p>This is a more visual alternative. Created by Tom \"PyTom\" Rothamel, Ren'Py was first released in 2004. It’s primarily designed to make visual novels (often romantic), allowing users to tell interactive stories using images, sounds, and text. Ren'Py's name is a combination of \"ren'ai,\" the Japanese word for romantic love, and Python, the programming language it’s built on.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/AO3i53agltRgq8NH0cq0AaViIh42-2024-12-06T13:00:12.229Z-ubbbo7audp2ivfbc7iof9a46\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>One of Ren'Py's strengths is its simplicity paired with powerful customization options.</strong> The basic scripting language is easy to learn, enabling creators to manage large storylines effortlessly. For more complex projects, users can add Python code to handle sophisticated game mechanics. <strong><a href=\"https://www.renpy.org/\">Ren'Py</a></strong> supports multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS, with additional support for animations, transitions, and save systems to enhance the gaming experience.</p>\n<p>\\\nRen'Py is funded primarily through community support, with donations coming from its Patreon page and sponsorships. As a project available on GitHub, they can also <strong><a href=\"https://kivach.org/repo/renpy/renpy\">receive donations via Kivach</a></strong>. Some notable games developed with this program include Vera Blanc (2010), The Royal Trap (2013), and Doki Doki Literature Club! (2017), each showcasing the engine’s versatility for both narrative depth and creativity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fungus\">Fungus</h2>\n<p>Released by Chris Gregan in 2014, Fungus is designed to help anyone create interactive storytelling games within Unity, even without coding experience. It’s particularly popular for visual novels, point-and-click adventures, and educational games. The software simplifies game development with its easy-to-learn interface, making it ideal for writers, illustrators, and animators who are new to Unity. It also supports more advanced developers by offering Lua scripting for additional customization.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/JTqOsars5yg?si=Wly-_6gPTR_F2iZ7&embedable=true\">https://youtu.be/JTqOsars5yg?si=Wly-<em>6gPTR</em>F2iZ7&embedable=true</a></p>\n<p><strong>One of Fungus’ standout features is its visual scripting system, which allows users to manage complex dialogues, characters, and game logic without writing code.</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://fungusgames.com/\">Fungus</a></strong> supports both 2D and 3D games, making it versatile for a variety of projects. It integrates smoothly with Unity’s features, allowing for the easy management of audio, camera controls, and internationalization of dialogue. This flexibility and simplicity make it a go-to tool for creating immersive and engaging story-based games.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis tool is funded by community support, as it’s free to use by anyone. If you use it and find it useful, you can consider <strong><a href=\"https://kivach.org/repo/snozbot/fungus\">donating to its team via Kivach</a></strong>. Some <strong><a href=\"https://fungusgames.com/games\">well-known projects</a></strong> created with Fungus include Sky Call (2015), Hotel Sara Belum (2015), Banished (2016), and Hack_It (2016).</p>\n<h2 id=\"textadventuredevelopmentsystemtads\">Text Adventure Development System (TADS)</h2>\n<p>This one is likely the grandpa of Interactive Fiction. First released in 1988 by Michael J. Roberts, TADS has gone through three major versions: 1, 2, and lately 3 —a complete rewrite of the original engine. Anyway, it’s still a powerful tool designed to help people create their own interactive stories, but it requires some degree of programming knowledge to do it.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/AO3i53agltRgq8NH0cq0AaViIh42-2024-12-06T13:00:12.231Z-brufjzalcdvcxhl8cr8cbzwf\" alt=\"HTML TADS for Windows, running The Golden Skull\" title=\"right-50\" /><strong><a href=\"https://www.tads.org/\">TADS</a></strong> provides a programming environment, making it ideal for those who enjoy coding, but it also aims to simplify the creation process, enabling authors to focus on building engaging stories. <strong>The software is packed with features like multimedia support for adding images, sounds, and even animations to enrich text-based games.</strong> TADS uses a programming language similar to C++ or JavaScript, which makes it appealing to experienced programmers.</p>\n<p>\\\nTADS is entirely free and open-source, sustained by a passionate community of interactive fiction enthusiasts. If you want to help with their support, you can <strong><a href=\"https://kivach.org/repo/tajmone/tads-sources\">send them some coins via Kivach</a></strong>. Some renowned games built with TADS include Uncle Zebulon’s Will (1995), 1893: A World’s Fair Mystery (2002), and The Elysium Enigma (2006).</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"trelby\">Trelby</h2>\n<p>\\\nScripts are also important to build some fiction, and here’s Trelby to help with it. It was initially released as \"Blyte\" in 2003 by Osku Salerma, but after its commercial sales faltered, the software was open-sourced in 2006. In 2011, developer Anil Gulecha revived the project, giving it a new name, Trelby, and adding modern features. Its main function is to provide screenwriters with a powerful, simple, and customizable tool for writing and formatting screenplays.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/AO3i53agltRgq8NH0cq0AaViIh42-2024-12-06T13:00:12.233Z-txy0q6vop6f7j0oow2ll2j1x\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.trelby.org/\">Trelby</a></strong> offers many useful features, including an intuitive editor that enforces proper screenplay formatting, auto-completion, and spell-checking. It runs on both Windows and Linux, providing identical output across platforms</strong>. Trelby supports multiple views for drafting, allows easy comparison between script versions, and includes a database of over 200,000 character names. It also has extensive import/export options, including support for popular screenplay formats like Final Draft and Fountain, and offers a built-in, customizable PDF generator.</p>\n<p>\\\nAs an open-source and free-to-use project, Trelby relies on community contributions for development. This makes it a valuable tool for writers interested in collaborative projects. For authors of Interactive Fiction, this could be an appealing resource for structuring narratives or screen-based storytelling projects, bridging the gap between traditional screenwriting and interactive narratives. <strong><a href=\"https://kivach.org/repo/trelby/trelby\">Interested in donating?

Most of them predict lofty prices and bull markets that will last at least another year or more.</p>\n<p>\\\nOne metric suggests they might be wrong.</p>\n<p>\\\nLet’s look at the Realized Cap HODL Waves, which splits holders into bands based on how long they’ve held their Bitcoins without moving them, then weighs each cohort by the price of those Bitcoins.</p>\n<p>\\\nIt’s the classic HODL waves plus a filter to weed out dead or lost Bitcoins.</p>\n<h1 id=\"supercyclehodlyourhorses\">Supercycle?

When Bitcoins move in and out of those funds, they don’t necessarily reflect the intent of the person buying and selling. As such, the related on-chain metric loses its significance.</p>\n<p>\\\nAt roughly 20% of the total volume on any given day, those ETFs account for no small portion of the on-chain activity. The problem will get worse over time.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhile you can’t compare today’s&nbsp;<em>numbers</em>&nbsp;with numbers from before January 2024, you can assume this metric still catches the general direction of behaviors.

      "content": "<p>OpenAI has recently announced a new subscription plan called <strong><a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-pro/\">ChatGPT Pro</a></strong>, priced at <strong>$200 per month</strong>. This plan includes access to the advanced <strong>o1 model</strong>, which now supports images and has improved skills in mathematics and coding. As someone who has been following these developments closely, here are my thoughts on this new offering.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"excitingupdateswiththeo1model\"><strong>Exciting Updates with the o1 Model</strong></h3>\n<p>I think it's really cool that OpenAI is making progress again. Recently, there were concerns that AI development had hit a plateau because it required much more power for even small breakthroughs. With the new o1 model, these fears are eased. The o1 model's ability to handle images and perform better in math and coding is impressive. It shows that AI is still advancing and becoming more capable.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"ischatgptproworththed200monthlyfee\"><strong>Is ChatGPT Pro Worth the $200 Monthly Fee?</strong></h3>\n<p>The price of $200 per month for ChatGPT Pro seems reasonable to me. There will definitely be people who are willing to pay this without hesitation. However, the big question is whether the service is good enough to keep subscribers. Some online reviews mention that ChatGPT Pro is about <strong>11% better in coding</strong> compared to the standard version. But considering it's usually <strong>10 times more expensive</strong> than the regular subscription, it might not be the best deal for everyone. For some, a cheaper alternative like <strong>Claude 3.5</strong> might be more appealing. I'm waiting to see what the first users have to say before making a final judgment.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"benefitsoftheo1promode\"><strong>Benefits of the o1 Pro Mode</strong></h3>\n<p>Access to the <strong>o1 pro mode</strong> is a major plus for users who work with more complex queries. I believe this will have a positive impact, especially for those in scientific fields like math, physics, chemistry, and medicine. With more powerful reasoning capabilities, the o1 pro mode can help achieve breakthroughs and solve difficult problems more efficiently.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"o1modelnowavailabletoallpaidusers\"><strong>o1 Model Now Available to All Paid Users</strong></h3>\n<p>Finally, OpenAI decided to make the o1 model available to all paid users and move it out of the preview stage. I'm really excited about this change and can't wait to try it out. It's great to see OpenAI making advanced models more accessible, allowing more people to benefit from their capabilities.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"newfeaturesvoicemoduleandbetterresponses\"><strong>New Features: Voice Module and Better Responses</strong></h3>\n<p>ChatGPT Pro also offers unlimited access to the voice module and improved answers to complex questions. However, I'm not sure how many users will regularly use the unlimited voice feature. It might be useful for some, but it may not be a deciding factor for everyone.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"rumorsofad2000monthlysubscription\"><strong>Rumors of a $2,000 Monthly Subscription</strong></h3>\n<p>There are also rumors about a <strong>$2,000 per month</strong> subscription. I can see this being a reality for professional, governmental, and scientific users. It would be something between the regular web version and API access, possibly providing access to <strong>AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)</strong> that can work on tasks for hours. This higher-tier subscription could be very valuable for those who need advanced AI capabilities for their work.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>OpenAI's ChatGPT Pro offers exciting new features and improved models like o1, but the high price tag may limit its appeal to a broader audience. It will be interesting to see how users respond and whether the benefits justify the cost. For those who need advanced AI for complex tasks, ChatGPT Pro could be a great investment. However, others might prefer sticking with more affordable options until they see more feedback from early adopters.</p>",

While HTTP/2 introduces innovative features like multiplexing and header compression, these enhancements pose new challenges for traditional security frameworks. Sankalp’s approach bridged this gap by enabling legacy systems to repurpose HTTP attack signatures for the newer protocol. “By enabling the system to use existing signatures designed for HTTP, we ensured that the newer protocol… received a similar level of robust protection,” he explains. This not only streamlined the adoption of HTTP/2 but also set a precedent for maintaining robust security without requiring entirely new detection architectures, thus establishing an industry benchmark.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn addition to enhancing protocol security, Sankalp excels at designing frameworks for real-time systems that demand both speed and security. To minimize latency while ensuring robust protection, he employs lightweight encryption algorithms such as ChaCha20 and AES-GCM. This allows data to be secured without introducing significant processing overhead. “Security measures are distributed across multiple layers—network, application, and endpoint—to avoid bottlenecks at any single point,” he notes, emphasizing the importance of multi-layered defenses. Non-critical operations, such as logging and analytics, are handled asynchronously, preserving system responsiveness even under heavy loads.</p>\n<p>\\\nAI-driven threat detection systems further enhance the efficiency of these frameworks by identifying potential risks swiftly without impeding traffic flow. To handle sudden surges in activity, Sankalp integrates secure caching and load balancing, ensuring that both performance and encryption remain uncompromised. His methodology exemplifies how advanced security measures can coexist with high performance in real-time environments, addressing the unique demands of modern, high-traffic applications with precision and foresight.</p>\n<h3 id=\"adaptingtoemergingcyberthreats\"><strong>Adapting to Emerging Cyber Threats</strong></h3>\n<p>The cybersecurity landscape is increasingly challenged by sophisticated threats, including AI-driven attacks and the potential risks of undermining current cryptographic standards by future powerful computers. Adversaries are using machine learning to bypass defenses and create targeted phishing campaigns. “Additionally, the increasing use of IoT devices introduces vulnerabilities due to weak security standards and the sheer scale of interconnected systems,” Sankalp notes.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo counter these threats, Sankalp integrates AI and machine learning into threat detection systems, staying ahead of evolving attack techniques. For IoT security, Sankalp advocates for stricter standards, robust authentication, and scalable frameworks to address unique vulnerabilities. His proactive approach underscores the importance of adaptability and foresight.</p>\n<p>\\\nSankalp envisions a future where cybersecurity becomes more intelligent and adaptive, with AI and automation predicting and preventing attacks before they occur. “IoT security will become a major focus, with tighter regulations and stronger device-level protections,” he predicts. Drawing on his expertise in building resilient systems, Sankalp is committed to driving innovation and influencing industry standards to meet the demands of an evolving threat landscape. “I see myself playing a central role in shaping this future,” he states.</p>\n<h3 id=\"buildingstrongsecurityfoundations\"><strong>Building Strong Security Foundations</strong></h3>\n<p>A robust security framework depends on several key components working in unison to provide comprehensive protection. According to Sankalp, strong identity management is foundational, with methods like multi-factor authentication and zero trust principles ensuring strict access control. “I prioritize identity management with multi-factor authentication and zero trust to control access,” he explains, emphasizing the importance of securing entry points against unauthorized users.</p>\n<p>\\\nProactive threat detection plays an equally critical role, leveraging AI and machine learning for real-time anomaly detection. This is complemented by signature-based systems to identify known threats effectively. For data protection, Sankalp highlights the use of encryption, scalable cryptographic solutions, and secure backups to safeguard against breaches or losses. “A well-defined incident response plan allows for swift containment and recovery,” he adds, noting that regular testing ensures these measures are always prepared for unexpected events. By tailoring the prioritization of these elements to a system’s specific risk profile, he ensures a security strategy that is both efficient and resilient.</p>\n<h3 id=\"adviceforaspiringcybersecurityexperts\"><strong>Advice for Aspiring Cybersecurity Experts</strong></h3>\n<p>Emphasizing a dual focus on technical expertise and strategic problem-solving, Sankalp highlights their importance for those entering the field of cybersecurity.

      "content": "<p>The other day I came across a service that verified the signature of requests on the server side. It was a small online casino, which for every request checked some value sent by the user from the browser. Regardless of what you were doing in the casino: placing a bet or making a deposit, an additional parameter in each request was the value “sign”, consisting of a set of seemingly random characters. It was impossible to send a request without it - the site returned an error, and it prevented me from sending my own custom requests.</p>\n<p>\\\nHad it not been for this value, I would have left the site at that moment and never thought of it again. But, against all odds, it wasn't the sense of quick profit that made me excited, but rather the research interest and challenge that the casino was giving me with its fool-proofing.</p>\n<p>\\\nRegardless of the purpose the developers had in mind when they added this parameter, it seems to me that it was a waste of time. After all, the signature itself is generated on the client side, and any client-side action can be subject to reverse-engineering.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn this article, I will discuss how I managed to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Resolve the request signature generation algorithm</li>\n<li>Write my own extension for Burp Suite that automates all the dirty work</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\nThis article will teach you how to save your precious time and reject useless solutions if you are a developer who is interested in doing secure projects. And if you are a pentester, after reading this article, you can learn some useful lessons on debugging as well as programming your own extensions for the Swiss Knife of security. In short, everyone is on the plus side.</p>\n<p>\\\nLet's finally get to the point.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ariadnesthreadunravelingthesignaturealgorithm\">Ariadne's thread: unraveling the signature algorithm</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-tr032s4.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nSo, the service is an online casino with a set of classic games:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plinko — a game where players drop a ball from the top of a peg-filled board, watching it bounce down to land in a slot with a win or lose value;</li>\n<li>Tickets — players purchase lottery tickets with a set of numbers and win if their numbers match the randomly drawn numbers;</li>\n<li>LiveDealers — online casino games conducted by real dealers in real-time, allowing players to watch and interact via video stream.</li>\n<li>Double — a simple game where players bet on whether the next card will be higher or lower than the current card.</li>\n<li>Crash — players bet and watch a multiplier increase, aiming to cash out before the multiplier crashes;</li>\n<li>Nvuti — players bet on whether a number will fall below or above a certain interval;</li>\n<li>Slots — casino games where players spin reels with symbols and win if certain combinations appear on the screen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nInteraction with the server works entirely on the basis of HTTP requests. Regardless of the game you choose, every POST request to the server must be signed - otherwise the server will generate an error. Signing requests in each of these games works on the same principle - I'll take only one game to investigate so that I don't have to do the same job twice.</p>\n<p>\\\nAnd I'm going to take a game called Dragon Dungeon.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-h5332wq.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThe essence of this game is to choose the doors in the castle sequentially in the role of a knight. Behind each door hides either a treasure or a dragon. If the player comes across a dragon behind a door, the game stops and he loses money. If the treasure is found - the amount of the initial bet increases and the game continues until the player takes the winnings, loses or passes all levels.</p>\n<p>\\\nBefore starting the game, the player must specify the amount of the bet and the number of dragons.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-f72326e.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nI enter the number 10 as the sum, leave one dragon and look at the request that will be sent. This can be done from the developer tools in any browser, in Chromium the Network tab is responsible for this.</p>\n<p>\\\nHere you can also see that the request was sent to the <code>/srv/api/v1/dungeon</code> endpoint.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-js4326l.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThe Payload tab displays the request body itself in JSON format</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-up532sb.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThe first two parameters are obvious - I chose them from the UI; the last one, as you might guess, is <code>timestamp</code> or the time that has passed since January 1, 1970, with the typical Javascript precision of milliseconds.</p>\n<p>\\\nThat leaves one unsolved parameter and, - and that's the signature itself. In order to understand how it is formed, I go to the Sources tab - this place contains all the resources of the service that the browser has loaded. Including Javascript, which is responsible for all the logic of the client part of the site.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-ax632t8.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nIt is not so easy to understand this code - it is minified. You can try to deobfuscate it all - but it is a long and tedious process that will take a lot of time (considering the amount of source code), I am not ready to do it.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe second and simpler option is to simply find the necessary part of the code by a keyword and use the debugger. That's what I will do, because I don't need to know how the whole site works, I just need to know how the signature is generated.</p>\n<p>\\\nSo, to find the part of the code that is responsible for generating the code, you can open a search through all the sources using the <code>CTRL+SHIFT+F</code> key combination and look for the assignment of a value to the <code>sign</code> key that is sent in the request.</p>\n<p>\\\nFortunately, there is only one match, which means I'm on the right track.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-p3732kd.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nIf you click on a match, you can get to the code section where the signature itself is generated. The code is obfuscated as before, so it is still difficult to read.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-oz832u8.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nOpposite the line of code I put a breakpoint, refresh the page and make a new bid in “dragons” - now the script has stopped its work exactly at the moment of signature formation, and you can see the state of some variables.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-6c932ot.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThe called function consists of one letter, the variables too - but no problem. You can go to the console and display the values of each of them. The situation starts to become clearer.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-0tb32cf.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThe first value I output is the value of the variable <code>H</code>, which is a function. You can click on it from the console and move to the place where it is declared in the code, below is the listing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-znc32q3.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThis is a pretty big snippet of code where I saw a clue - SHA256. This is a hashing algorithm. You can also see that two parameters are passed to the function, which hints that this may not just be SHA256, but HMAC SHA256 with a secret.</p>\n<p>\\\nProbably the variables that are passed here (also output to the console):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>string <code>10;1;6693a87bbd94061678473bfb;1732817300080;gRdVWfmU-YR_RCuSkWFLCUTly_GZfDx3KEM8</code> - directly the value to which the HMAC SHA256 operation is applied.</li>\n<li><code>31754cff-be0f-446f-9067-4cd827ba8707</code> is a static constant that acts as a secret</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nTo make sure of this, I call the function and get the assumed signature</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-and328d.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nNow I go to the site that counts HMAC SHA256 and pass values into it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-oqe32n3.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nAnd comparing it to the one that was sent in the request when I placed the bid.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-pfg32zj.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThe result is identical, which means that my guesses were correct - it really uses HMAC SHA256 with a static secret, which is passed a specially formed string with the rate, number of dragons and some other parameters, which I will tell you about further on in the course of the article.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe algorithm is quite simple and straightforward. But it's still not enough - if it was a goal within a work project for pentest to find vulnerabilities, I would need to learn how to send my own queries using Burp Suite.</p>\n<p>\\\nAnd this definitely needs automation, which is what I'm going to talk about now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"isitevennecessarytowriteyourownextension\">Is it even necessary to write your own extension?</h2>\n<p>I have figured out the algorithm of signature generation. Now it's time to learn how to generate it automatically in order to abstract away all the unnecessary stuff when sending requests.</p>\n<p>\\\nYou can send requests using ZAP, Caido, Burp Suite, and other pentest tools. This article will focus on Burp Suite, as I find it to be the most user-friendly and almost perfect. Community Edition can be <a href=\"https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload\">downloaded</a> for free from the official site, it is enough for all experiments.</p>\n<p>\\\nOut of the box Burp Suite does not know how to generate HMAC SHA256. Therefore, in order to do this, you can use extensions that complement Burp Suite's functionality.</p>\n<p>\\\nExtensions are created both by community members and by the developers themselves. They are distributed either through the built-in free BApp Store, Github, or other source code repositories.</p>\n<p>\\\nThere are two paths you can take:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use an off-the-shelf extension from the BApp Store</li>\n<li>Write your own extension</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\nEach of these paths has its pros and cons, I will show you both.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gettingtoknowhackvertor\">Getting to know Hackvertor</h3>\n<p>The method with a ready-made extension is the easiest. It is to download it from the BApp Store and use its features to generate a value for the <code>sign</code> parameter.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe extension I used is called <a href=\"https://portswigger.net/bappstore/65033cbd2c344fbabe57ac060b5dd100\">Hackvertor</a>. It allows you to use XML like syntax so that you can dynamically encode/decode, encrypt/decrypt, hash various data.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn order to install it, Burp requires:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Go to the Extensions tab</p></li>\n<li><p>Type Hackvertor in the search</p></li>\n<li><p>Select the found extension in the list</p></li>\n<li><p>Click Install</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-keh32xw.png\" alt=\"\" /></p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\nOnce it is installed, a tab with the same name will appear in Burp. You can go to it and evaluate the capabilities of the extension and the number of available tags, each of which can be combined with each other.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-0wi32de.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nTo give an example, you can encrypt something with symmetric AES using the tag <code>&lt;@aes_encrypt('supersecret12356','AES/ECB/PKCS5PADDING')&gt;MySuperSecretText&lt;@/aes_encrypt&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe secret and algorithm are in brackets, and between the tags is the text itself to be encrypted. Any tags can be used in Repeater, Intruder and other built-in Burp Suite tools.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-4kj3228.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nWith the help of Hackvertor extension you can describe how a signature should be generated at the tag level. I'm going to do it on the example of a real request.</p>\n<h3 id=\"usinghackvertorincombat\">Using Hackvertor in combat</h3>\n<p>So, I make a bet in Dragon Dungeon, intercept the same request I intercepted at the beginning of this article with Intercept Proxy, and stress it into Repeater to be able to edit it and resubmit it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-yxk32dj.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nNow in place of the <code>ae04afe621864f569022347f1d1adcaa3f11bebec2116d49c4539ae1d2c825fc</code> value, we need to substitute the algorithm to generate HMAC SHA256 using the tags provided by Hackvertor.</p>\n<p>\\\nФормула генерации у меня получилась следующая <code>&lt;@hmac_sha256('31754cff-be0f-446f-9067-4cd827ba8707')&gt;10;1;6693a87bbd94061678473bfb;&lt;@timestamp/&gt;000;MDWpmNV9-j8tKbk-evbVLtwMsMjKwQy5YEs4&lt;@/hmac_sha256&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>\\\nConsider all the parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>10</code> - bet amount</li>\n<li><code>1</code> - number of dragons</li>\n<li><code>6693a87bbd94061678473bfb</code> - unique user ID from MongoDB database, I saw it while analyzing the signature from the browser, but I didn't write about it then. I was able to find it by searching through the contents of the queries in Burp Suite, it comes back from the <code>/srv/api/v1/profile/me</code> endpoint query.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-cil32ms.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><code>&lt;@timestamp/&gt;000</code> - timestamp generation, the last three zeros refines the time to milliseconds</p></li>\n<li><p><code>MDWpmNV9-j8tKbk-evbVLtwMsMjKwQy5YEs4</code> - CSRF token, which is returned from <code>/srv/api/v1/csrf</code> endpoint, and substituted in each request, in <code>X-Xsrf-Token</code> header.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-0xm32bz.png\" alt=\"\" /></p></li>\n<li><p><code>&lt;@hmac_sha256('31754cff-be0f-446f-9067-4cd827ba8707')&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;@/hmac_sha256&gt;</code> - opening and closing tags for generating HMAC SHA256 from the substituted value with the secret as a constant <code>31754cff-be0f-446f-9067-4cd827ba8707</code>.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nImportant to note: the parameters must be connected to each other via <code>;</code> in strict order, - otherwise the signature will be generated incorrectly - as in this screenshot where I have swapped the rate and the number of dragons</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-vun32kt.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThat's where all the magic lies.</p>\n<p>\\\nNow I make a correct query, where I specify the parameters in the correct order, and get information that everything was successful and the game started - this means that Hackvertor generated a signature instead of a formula, substituted it into the query, and everything works.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-2ho325u.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nHowever, this method has a significant disadvantage - you can't get rid of manual work completely. Every time you change the rate or number of dragons in JSON, you have to change it in the signature itself to make them match.</p>\n<p>\\\nAlso, if you send a new request from the Proxy tab to Intruder or Repeater, you have to re-write the formula, which is very, very inconvenient when you need many tabs for different test cases.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis formula will also fail in other queries where other parameters are used.</p>\n<p>\\\nSo I decided to write my own extension to overcome these disadvantages.</p>\n<h2 id=\"discoverallthemagicofburpwithyourextension\">Discover all the magic of Burp with your extension</h2>\n<h3 id=\"initialsettings\">Initial settings</h3>\n<p>You can write extensions for Burp Suite in Java and Python. I will use the second programming language as it is simpler and more visual. But you need to prepare yourself beforehand: first you need to download Jython Standalone from the official website, and then the path to the downloaded file in Burp Suite settings.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-2yp32qm.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nAfter that, you need to create a file with the source code itself and the extension <code>*.py</code>.</p>\n<p>\\\nI already have a billet that defines the basic logic, here are its contents:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-hpq32jt.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nEverything is intuitively simple and straightforward:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>getActionName</code> - this method returns the name of the action to be performed by the extension. The extension itself adds a Session Handling Rule that can be flexibly applied to any of the requests, but more on that later. It is important to know that this name may be different from the extension's name, and that it will be selectable from the interface.</li>\n<li><code>performAction</code> - the logic of the rule itself, which will be applied to the selected requests, will be spelled out here</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nBoth methods are declared according to the <a href=\"https://portswigger.net/burp/extender/api/burp/isessionhandlingaction.html\">ISessionHandlingAction</a> interface.</p>\n<p>\\\nNow to the <a href=\"https://portswigger.net/burp/extender/api/burp/iburpextender.html\">IBurpExtender</a> interface. It declares the only necessary method <code>registerExtenderCallbacks</code>, which is executed immediately after loading the extension, and is needed for it to work at all.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis is where the basic configuration is done:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>callbacks.setExtensionName(EXTENSION_NAME)</code> - registers the current extension as an action to handle sessions</li>\n<li><code>sys.stdout = callbacks.getStdout()</code> - redirects the standard output (stdout) to the Burp Suite output window (the “Extensions” panel)</li>\n<li><code>self.stderr = PrintWriter(callbacks.getStdout(), True)</code> - creates a stream for outputting errors</li>\n<li><code>self.stdout.println(EXTENSION_NAME)</code> - prints the name of the extension in Burp Suite</li>\n<li><code>self.callbacks = callbacks</code> - saves the callbacks object as a self attribute. This is needed for later use of the Burp Suite API in other parts of the extension code.</li>\n<li><code>self.helpers = callbacks.getHelpers()</code> - also gets useful methods that will be needed as the extension runs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nWith the preliminary preparations done, that's it. Now you can load the extension and make sure that it works at all. To do this, go to the Extensions tab and click Add.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-m3r32lu.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>In the window that appears, specify</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extension type - Python, or the programming language in which the extension is written</li>\n<li>Extension file - the path to the extension file itself.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nAnd click Next.  <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-fes323k.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nIf the source code file has been properly formatted, no errors should occur, and the Output tab will display the name of the extension. This means that everything is working fine.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-jjt32lr.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"atestofthepen\">A test of the pen</h3>\n<p>The extension loads and works - but all that was loaded was a wrapper without any logic, now I need the code directly to sign the request. I have already written it and it is shown in the screenshot below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-you326v.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThe way the whole extension works is that before the request is sent to the server, it will be modified by my extension.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-l6v324p.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nI first take the request that the extension intercepted, and get the rate, and the number of dragons, from its body</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">json_body = json.loads(message_body)\n\namount_currency = json_body[\"amountCurrency\"]\ndragons = json_body[\"dragons\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nNext, I read the current Timestamp and get the CSRF token from the corresponding header</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">currentTime = str(time.time()).split('.')[0]+'100'\n\nxcsrf_token = None\nfor header in headers:\n    if header.startswith(\"X-Xsrf-Token\"):\n        xcsrf_token = header.split(\":\")[1].strip()\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nNext, the request itself is signed using HMAC SHA256</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">hmac_sign = hmac_sha256(key, message=\";\".join([str(amount_currency), str(dragons), user_id, currentTime, xcsrf_token]))\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nThe function itself and the constants denoting the secret and the user ID were pre-declared at the top</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">def hmac_sha256(key, message):\n    return hmac.new(\n        key.encode(\"utf-8\"), \n        message.encode(\"utf-8\"), \n        hashlib.sha256\n    ).hexdigest()\n\nkey = \"434528cb-662f-484d-bda9-1f080b861392\"\nuser_id = \"zex2q6cyc4ba3gvkyex5f80m\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nThen the values are written to the request body and converted to JSON</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">json_body[\"sign\"] = hmac_sign\njson_body[\"t\"] = currentTime\n\nmessage_body = json.dumps(json_body)\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nThe final step is to generate a signed and modified request and send it to</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">httpRequest = self.helpers.buildHttpMessage(get_final_headers, message_body)\nbaseRequestResponse.setRequest(httpRequest)\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nThat's all, the source code is written. Now you can reload the extension in Burp Suite (it should be done after each script modification), and make sure that everything works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"testingthenewruleinaction\">Testing the new rule in action</h3>\n<p>But first you need to add a new rule for processing requests. To do this, go to Settings, to the Sessions section. Here you will find all the different rules that are triggered when sending requests.</p>\n<p>\\\nClick Add to add an extension that triggers on certain types of requests.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-qyw32cf.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nIn the window that appears, I leave everything as it is and select Add in Rule actions</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-epx32kg.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nA drop-down list will appear. In it, select Invoke a Burp extension.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-wky32op.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nAnd specify for it the extension that will be called when sending requests. I have one, and it is Burp Extension.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-b4z32lp.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>After selecting the extension, I click OK. And I go to the Scope tab, where I specify:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Tools scope - Repeater (the extension should trigger when I send requests manually through Repeater)</p></li>\n<li><p>URL Scope - Include all URLs (so that it works on all requests I send).</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It should work like in the screenshot below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-va1032r6.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nAfter clicking OK, the extension rule appeared in the general list.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-go1132yo.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nFinally, you can test everything in action! Now you can change some query and see how the signature will dynamically update. And even though the query will fail, it will be because I chose a negative rate, not because there is something wrong with the signature (I just don't want to waste money 😀). The extension itself works and the signature is generated correctly.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-hm1232yt.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"bringingittoperfection\">Bringing it to perfection</h3>\n<p>Everything is great, but there are three problems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The CSRF token is taken from the header. Generally it should be disposable, but probably here it has a lifetime (or not, which is wrong). In any case, it would be more correct to make a separate request itself to get a new one and update it. 2- A predefined user ID is used. If I want to check IDOR on this service, my previous script will become invalid for another user, since the ID is hardcoded.</li>\n<li>Different queries can have different parameters. And the scheme that was described for the script initially will be valid only for Dungeon Dragons, and no other. And I would like to be able to edit and send any request.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\nTo solve this, we need to add two additional requests, which can be done by the built-in Burp Suite library, instead of any third-party ones, instead of <code>requests</code>.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo do this, I've wrapped some standard logic to make the queries more convenient. Through Burp's standard methods, the interaction with queries is done in pleintext.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">def makeRequest(self, method=\"GET\", path=\"/\", headers=None, body=None):\n    first_line = method + \" \" + path + \" HTTP/1.1\"\n    headers[0] = first_line\n\n    if body is None:\n        body = \"{}\"\n\n    http_message = self.helpers.buildHttpMessage(headers, body)\n    return self.callbacks.makeHttpRequest(self.request_host, self.request_port, True, http_message)\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nAnd added two functions extracting the data I need, CSRF token, and UserID.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">def get_csrf_token(self, headers):\n    response = self.makeRequest(\"GET\", \"/srv/api/v1/csrf\", headers)\n    message = self.helpers.analyzeRequest(response)\n\n    raw_headers = str(message.getHeaders())\n    match = re.search(r'XSRF-TOKEN=([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)', raw_headers)\n    return match.group(1)\n\ndef get_user_id(self, headers):\n    raw_response = self.makeRequest(\"POST\", \"/srv/api/v1/profile/me\", headers)\n    response = self.helpers.bytesToString(raw_response)\n\n    match = re.search(r'\"_id\":\"([a-f0-9]{24})\"', response)\n    return match.group(1)\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nAnd by updating the token itself in the sent headers</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">def update_csrf(self, headers, token):\n    for i, header in enumerate(headers):\n        if header.startswith(\"X-Xsrf-Token:\"):\n            headers[i] = \"X-Xsrf-Token: \" + token\n        return headers\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nThe signature function looks like this. Here it is important to note that I take all the custom parameters that are sent in the request, add the standard <code>user_id</code>, <code>currentTime</code>, <code>csrf_token</code> to the end of them, and sign them all together using <code>;</code> as a separator.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">def sign_body(self, json_body, user_id, currentTime, csrf_token):\n    values = []\n    for key, value in json_body.items():\n        if key == \"sign\":\n            break\n        values.append(str(value))\n\n    values.extend([str(user_id), str(currentTime), str(csrf_token)])\n    return hmac_sha256(hmac_secret, message=\";\".join(values))\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nThe main floo got reduced to a few lines:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>CSRF token and UserID acquisition is performed</li>\n<li>Timestamp is calculated and a signature is generated based on all parameters. It is important to note here that I am using <code>OrderedDict</code> which generates the dictionary in a rigid sequence as it is important to preserve it while signing.</li>\n<li>The final body of the request is generated and it is sent onward</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code class=\"python language-python\">csrf_token = self.get_csrf_token(headers)\nfinal_headers = self.update_csrf(final_headers, csrf_token)\nuser_id = self.get_user_id(headers)\ncurrentTime = str(time.time()).split('.')[0]+'100'\n\njson_body = json.loads(message_body, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)\nsign = self.sign_body(json_body, user_id, currentTime, csrf_token)\n\njson_body[\"sign\"] = sign\njson_body[\"t\"] = currentTime\n\nmessage_body = json.dumps(json_body)\n\nhttpRequest = self.helpers.buildHttpMessage(final_headers, message_body)\nbaseRequestResponse.setRequest(httpRequest)\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nA screenshot, just to be sure</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-q4133234.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nNow, if you go to some other game where custom parameters are already 3 instead of 2, and send a request, you can see that it will be sent successfully. This means that my extension is now universal and works for all requests.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-7u14329q.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nExample of sending a request for account replenishment</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-b415323e.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Extensions are an integral part of Burp Suite. Often services implement custom functionality that no one else but you will write in advance.

      "content": "An anonymous reader shared this report from Defense News:\nFollowing a pattern of undersea cable damage across European waters in the last year, with the most recent disruptions happening just weeks ago, top NATO officials have begun envisioning a capability that would allow the alliance to have permanent eyes above and under the waterline. In an interview with Defense News, Admiral Pierre Vandier, the alliance's Norfolk, Virginia-based commander for concepts and transformation, likened the idea to police CCTV cameras installed on street lights in urban trouble spots for recording evidence of crimes. \"The technology is there to make this street-lighting with USVs,\" he said, using the military's shorthand for unmanned surface vessel. Vandier said his team is in the early stages of developing an unmanned surface vessel fleet so that \"NATO can see and monitor daily its environment.\" \n\nThe first step would be to achieve this at a surface level, and then later under water... According to Vandier, the goal is to launch the drone surveillance fleet before the next NATO Summit, which will be held in the Netherlands next June. \n\nThe article notes the U.S. Navy's Task Force 59 (launched in 2021) is already \"dedicated to integrating unmanned systems and AI in the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet area of operations.\" This prompted Admiral Vandier to say the technology for an unmanned cable-watching fleet \"already exists... everything is known and sold, so it is much more a matter of adoption than technology.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=NATO+Considers+Watching+Undersea+Internet+Cables+with+a+Fleet+Unmanned+Boats%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F0528240%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F0528240%2Fnato-considers-watching-undersea-internet-cables-with-a-fleet-unmanned-boats%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/12/05/0528240/nato-considers-watching-undersea-internet-cables-with-a-fleet-unmanned-boats?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23542103&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",
