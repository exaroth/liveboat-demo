After all, it was a band of color-coordinated heroes who traded gentle quips and used martial arts to dispatch endless faceless baddies. I watched MMPR at the time, but I was also just cresting the age at which I felt a little embarrassed by its undeniable camp. Three decades later, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind once again feels a bit like it's riding the turtles' coattails. TMNT: Shredder's Revenge was an excellent retro brawler throwback, and by comparison, Rita's Rewind is a <em>pretty good</em> retro brawler throwback, but one with some of its own special charms--as well as its own frustrations.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Rita's Rewind fully recognizes the passage of time, even pinning down specific years. The original Rangers are still fighting evil in 2023, now against a mechanized Robo Rita--a timely reference to the villain of the reunion movie, 2023's Power Rangers: Once and Always. But apparently overwhelmed by these Rangers who have decades of experience, Robo Rita hatches a plan to go back in time and team up with her flesh-and-blood self. The modern-day Rangers say it's too dangerous to follow her through time and risk a paradox, so they just have to hope their younger selves are able to withstand the machinations of two Ritas.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">That places Rita's Rewind strictly on the 1993 timeline, which means it's the first time the Rangers are encountering mainstays like Goldar and the Green Ranger. The only real difference is that this time we see Rita Repulsa bickering with Robo Rita over strategy.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-review-the-90s-sure-were-weird/1900-6418325/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1585/15855271/4411502-ss_47818674f66a0099c3a0f6b5e8cb68e6454acb86.jpg","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Zen and the Art of Aibo Engineering","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/aibo","date":1733752803,"author":"Tim Hornyak","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>An original Aibo engineer reflects on 25 years of Sony’s robot dog</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTEyOTE5Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODUzNjY0NX0.TP811badj_W0V_0vmLTeaXA-5RQHa8Sa-3LU3XEGKzs/image.jpg?width=600","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Rust-Based, Memory-Safe PNG Decoders \"Vastly Outperform\" C-Based PNG Libraries","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Rust-PNG-Outperforms-C-PNG","date":1733753129,"author":"Michael Larabel","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Video and image encoders/decoders written in the Rust programming language for its memory safety guarantees is often viewed as one of the compelling areas for the programming language to better protect against malformed/malicious content especially within web browsers.

In an interview with The Verge, Suleyman, who oversees Microsoft's consumer AI products including Bing and Copilot, called current search interfaces \"completely broken\" and \"a total pain,\" arguing that voice-based AI interactions will prove \"100 times easier\" for users. He said: The UI that you experience is going to be automagically produced by an LLM in three or five years, and that is going to be the default. And they'll be representing the brands, businesses, influencers, celebrities, academics, activists, and organizations, just as each one of those stakeholders in society ended up getting a podcast, getting a website, writing a blog, maybe building an app, or using the telephone back in the day. \n\nThe technological revolution produces a new interface, which completely shuffles the way that things are distributed. And some organizations adapt really fast and they jump on board and it kind of transforms their businesses and their organizations, and some don't. There will be an adjustment. We'll look back by 2030 and be like, \"Oh, that really was the kind of moment when there was this true inflection point because these conversational AIs really are the primary way that we have these interactions.\" And so, you're absolutely right. A brand and a business are going to use that AI to talk to your personal companion AI because I don't really like doing that kind of shopping. And some people do, and they'll do that kind of direct-to-consumer browsing experience. Many people don't like it, and it's actually super frustrating, hard, and slow. \n\nAnd so, increasingly you'll come to work with your personal AI companion to go and be that interface, to go and negotiate, find great opportunities, and adapt them to your specific context. That'll just be a much more efficient protocol because AIs can talk to AIs in super real-time. And by the way, let's not fool ourselves. We already have this on the open web today. We have behind-the-scenes, real-time negotiation between buyers and sellers of ad space, or between search ranking algorithms. So, there's already that kind of marketplace of AIs. It's just not explicitly manifested in language. It's operating in vector space.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Microsoft+AI+Chief+Says+Conversational+AI+Will+Replace+Web+Browsers%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F09%2F1548200%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F09%2F1548200%2Fmicrosoft-ai-chief-says-conversational-ai-will-replace-web-browsers%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://slashdot.org/story/24/12/09/1548200/microsoft-ai-chief-says-conversational-ai-will-replace-web-browsers?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23546247&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"More Is Better in Error-Resilient Quantum Computer","url":"https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-error-correction-2670337688","date":1733760850,"author":"Charles Q.

The research demonstrated significant error reduction when scaling up from 3x3 to 7x7 grids of quantum bits, with errors dropping by half at each step. The advance addresses quantum computing's core challenge of maintaining stable quantum states, which typically last only microseconds. \n\nGoogle's new quantum chip, manufactured in-house, maintains quantum states for nearly 100 microseconds -- five times longer than previous versions. The company aims to build a full-scale system with about 1 million qubits, projecting costs around $1 billion by decade's end. \n\nIBM, Google's main rival, questioned the scalability of Google's \"surface code\" error correction approach, claiming it would require billions of qubits. IBM is pursuing an alternative three-dimensional design requiring new connector technology expected by 2026. The breakthrough parallels the first controlled nuclear chain reaction in 1942, according to MIT physics professor William Oliver, who noted that both achievements required years of engineering to realize theoretical predictions from decades earlier. \n\nFurther reading: Google: Meet Willow, our state-of-the-art quantum chip.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Scientific+Breakthrough+Gives+New+Hope+To+Building+Quantum+Computers%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F09%2F1715219%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F09%2F1715219%2Fscientific-breakthrough-gives-new-hope-to-building-quantum-computers%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/12/09/1715219/scientific-breakthrough-gives-new-hope-to-building-quantum-computers?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23546347&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"GNU Shepherd 1.0 Service Manager Released As \"Solid Tool\" Alternative To systemd","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/GNU-Shepherd-1.0","date":1733769739,"author":"Michael Larabel","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"GNU Shepherd as a service manager for both system and user services that is used by Guix and relying on Guile Scheme has finally reached version 1.0.

The verdict, which echoed a previously undisclosed finding from a 2020 US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigation, centered on discrimination claims based on race and national origin. Cognizant, based in Teaneck, New Jersey, was found to have preferred workers from India, most of whom joined the firm's US workforce of about 32,000 using skilled-worker visas called H-1Bs. \n\nThe case is part of a wave of recent discrimination claims against IT outsourcing companies that underscore growing concerns that these firms have exploited a broken employment-visa system to secure a cheaper, more malleable workforce. In the process, US workers say they've been disadvantaged. The industry, which provides computer services to other companies, makes extensive use of H-1Bs; over the past decade and a half, no employer has obtained more of them than Cognizant, federal records

Trend Inflation Volatility</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"b2flexiblepriceequilibriumandzinss44\">B.2 Flexible Price Equilibrium and ZINSS (4.4)</h2>\n<p>This subsection clarifies remarks concerning the relationship between the optimal reset price and the flexible price equilibrium, including their coincidence when there is zero inflation. To achieve this I introduce a little mathematical machinery, that I understand to be original. Under monopolistic competition, I find that the optimal price is a mark-up m = 1/(θ − 1) over marginal costs, so in real terms</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-aua30e4.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nIt is worth briefly motivating this definition. Continuity and increasing requirements support the idea of the mean as an average and rule out alternative measures of location, such as median and mode.[106] The function space assumption allows us to include expectations of future variables, as part of our average ensemble. It is this averaging property that underpins ergodicity and mixing in the model.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-eob30ed.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>Proof</em>. Weak measurability comes from the structure of the optimization problem. Monotonicity and continuity follow from the following implicit function argument, where the left-hand side is (27), combined with (199) and the gross inflation definition (23) on the right-hand side</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-vvc30f7.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nHence</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-8bd30e6.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Corollary 3.</strong> <em>ZINSS is equivalent to a flexible price equilibrium.</em></p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-67e3048.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nTherefore uniquely at ZINSS the reset price constraint is not binding. This confirms the breakdown of nominal rigidity as the root cause of the bifurcation. The other weighted measures feature expectations of non-linear terms and are therefore not amenable to our definition.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Remark 36.</strong> <em>These results carry over easily to alternative settings with finite price lives. This includes Taylor pricing and models where the price spell is truncated, such as Wolman [1999] and Dixon and Le Bihan [2012].</em></p>\n<p>\\\nThe final result justifies a comment in Footnote 25 in Section 4.4. It explains the distinction between the reset price and the flexible price. Moreover, it presages the idea of a limiting fringe of flexible price firms, used in Section 9.5 to make distinctions between real and nominal rigidity.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Proposition 28.</strong> <em>The magnitude of the change in the reset price weakly exceeds the change in the price of a firm that always had flexible prices, with equality only when neither price changes.</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>Proof</em>. Since price re-setters are randomly assigned here, by a standard law of large numbers argument, the reset price inflation is given by</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-26f30xo.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nA flexible price firm will always set its price equal to the general price level</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/fWZa4tUiBGemnqQfBGgCPf9594N2-5lg30q5.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n(202) corresponds to Proposition 1, the economic idea that the relative price of the re-setter is increasing in inflation. Intuitively, with rigid prices to generate inflation or deflation, re-setters have to adjust more aggressively than in the flexible price world, in order to make up for the portion of the price level that does not change. This is why we cannot naively compare observed price changes with a classical benchmark to obtain the spillover from rigid prices to flexible prices.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::info\nThis paper is <a

But I’ve abandoned so many projects in the past that it feels like the right time to work on building my dedication and commitment.</p>\n<p>Now, the first week of my 4-week journey is behind me, and if I had to sum it up in one word, it would be <em>different</em>. My goal this week was to focus on micro-tasks and test how consistent I could be. These tasks included things like drawing for 15 minutes, reading 30 pages of a technical book, and steering clear of sweets with added sugars.</p>\n<p>The image in the header features my self-made calendar, complete with cute wooden flowers that I use to mark each day I successfully complete my tasks. This week, I managed to earn those flowers for four days - not perfect, but far from failure. Let me tell you why.</p>\n<h3 id=\"morningroutinessmallchangesbigimpact\">Morning Routines: Small Changes, Big Impact</h3>\n<p>I started waking up an hour earlier each day (6:30am), feeling surprisingly refreshed. After a much-needed cold splash of water to my face I used this time to journal my thoughts, without focusing on my upcoming days, instead just reflecting on the past ones, noting down some important moments that I’d love to remember always. But I am curious, how many of you that started a journal actually went back to read a well-forgotten day in your lives? I guess I should keep a mental note to check up on my physical notes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"workdayfindingbalance\">Workday: Finding Balance</h3>\n<p>To make my workday more intentional, I added 10-minute focus breaks every 90 minutes. During these breaks, I read my technical book, did some small sketches or simply stretched and took deep breaths, all the time contemplating if I should turn the 10 minutes into 20 😳. In all honesty, this micro change did switch up the rhythm and helped me extend my proactive workflow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"eveningstheonlypartofthedayicandowhatiwant\">Evenings: The only part of the day I can do what I want</h3>\n<p>The idea is to have at least three “out of the ordinary” evenings a week, this time I only managed to squeeze in two:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tuesday</strong>: My “mystery walk” through Amsterdam was an opportunity for me to feel comfortable when I’m not in control of the situation. Technically, I know I’m never truly in control; life is just a series of coincidental events steering me along, but I like to pretend otherwise by planning everything - knowing where I’m going, what to expect, and mapping out every step. This time I went out with my girlfriend and asked her to randomly pick the directions we took. Surprisingly, we ended up right at our metro station. Funny how the world works.</li>\n<li><strong>Sunday</strong>: Instead of the planned improv class, I tried rock climbing and bouldering. It was intimidating at first, looking up and seeing “you can break a leg” heights. So, the tactic I chose to fight this unexpected fear was taking one step at a time and only focusing on the next step - fastening the rope… pulling on the rope really tightly… pulling once again just to be sure… and next thing you know, I’m far too high from the ground to say it’s comfortable. But something about the process - being alone with my thoughts, planning my next move, and trusting my body to reach those milestones - made me feel incredibly in tune with myself. I’m someone who can’t do one pull-up and I had the wrong impression it’s going to stop me from reaching the top, so accomplishing that reminded me why I’m on this journey: to learn more about myself and push my limits.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"movingforward\">Moving Forward</h3>\n<p>I’d say I’ve done more than enough in the first week of this journey. One of my goals was to be kind to myself if things didn’t go as planned, and I believe I’ve done just that. How do I know? Well, reading through this blog brought a smile to my face. Now that I’ve experienced it, I’m even more excited to share week 2 with you. Here’s a small spoiler: it involves lasagnas and me finally starting to feel like I’m fitting in.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for week 2! And let me know if you've recently tried breaking any patterns - I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Musicians Rally Behind Internet Archive in $621 Million Music Label Battle","url":"https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/24/12/09/2218212/musicians-rally-behind-internet-archive-in-621-million-music-label-battle?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1733785200,"author":"msmash","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Over 300 musicians have signed an open letter defending the Internet Archive against a $621 million copyright infringement lawsuit over its preservation of 78 rpm records.

But in the AI arms race, Siri has struggled to keep pace with conversational powerhouses like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. A significant change might be on the horizon, as Apple is reportedly working on a new version of Siri powered by large language models (LLMs). Internally referred to as \"LLM Siri,\" this upgrade could transform the way users interact with their devices.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatweknowsofar\"><strong>What We Know So Far</strong></h2>\n<p>According to a recent <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-21/apple-readies-more-conversational-llm-siri-in-bid-to-rival-openai-s-chatgpt?utm_source=superhuman&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=anthropic-and-aws-join-forces\">Bloomberg report</a>, Apple’s advanced Siri version is scheduled for release in 2026, with an official announcement expected as early as 2025. While the full rollout might take years, some features could arrive sooner. iOS users may see incremental updates that bridge the gap between today’s Siri and its future LLM-powered counterpart.</p>\n<p>The revamped Siri is expected to handle complex, multi-step tasks, including navigating third-party apps and delivering more conversational responses. This contrasts sharply with Siri’s current limitations, which often leave users reaching for rival apps to complete advanced queries or tasks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyitmatters\"><strong>Why It Matters</strong></h2>\n<p>Voice assistants have become a central aspect of the mobile ecosystem, but the rise of advanced AI tools like ChatGPT has shifted expectations. ChatGPT, which landed on iOS in May 2023, already integrates cutting-edge capabilities such as history synchronization and voice input powered by Whisper, OpenAI’s speech recognition technology (<a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-chatgpt-app-for-ios/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">OpenAI Blog</a>). With Gemini rumored to join the platform soon, Apple faces mounting pressure to maintain Siri's relevance.</p>\n<p>Integrating LLMs into Siri could open the door to more personalized and proactive interactions. Imagine Siri scheduling your day, booking travel, or managing third-party apps—all without the need for specific commands. However, this move also raises questions about Apple’s relationships with companies like Alphabet (the parent company of Google) and OpenAI, especially as these platforms gain more traction on iOS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thebroaderailandscape\"><strong>The Broader AI Landscape</strong></h2>\n<p>Apple isn’t alone in its pursuit of smarter AI. Google recently launched Gemini, its next-generation conversational AI, and Microsoft has integrated OpenAI’s models into Bing. While Apple has been relatively quiet about its AI advancements, the company is undoubtedly investing heavily in this area. Earlier this year, reports suggested Apple spent millions daily on training its AI models (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/21/24302685/apple-llm-siri-compete-chatgpt?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">The Verge</a>).</p>\n<p>This competition isn’t just about who can build the smartest assistant; it’s also about shaping the future of AI monetization. Enhanced AI tools could generate billions in new revenue streams through app integrations, subscriptions, and services, as highlighted in <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-ai-stock-siri-ff07951b?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Barron’s</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatsnextforappleandsiri\"><strong>What’s Next for Apple and Siri?</strong></h2>\n<p>While \"LLM Siri\" promises a major leap forward, Apple’s traditional approach to product secrecy leaves much unknown. Will Siri’s enhancements be tied exclusively to iPhones, or will we see broader integrations across Apple’s ecosystem, from Macs to wearables? And more importantly, can it match—or surpass—the user experience offered by ChatGPT and Gemini?</p>\n<p>For now, Apple is playing the long game. The arrival of ChatGPT and potentially Gemini on iOS devices will challenge Siri to evolve rapidly. Whether \"LLM Siri\" delivers on its promise will ultimately depend on how Apple balances innovation with user trust and privacy—two cornerstones of its brand ethos.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>What are your thoughts on Apple’s plans for Siri? Is \"LLM Siri\" the upgrade it needs to stay competitive, or has the AI train already left the station?

It's really about people finding their own alternatives to what isn't working for them.</p>\n<p>\\\nLegitimate and in-demand use cases for Open Money could include easier cross-border payments, a better way to find yield or store value, or monetizing creative work without having to become an affiliate or an influencer.</p>\n<p>\\\nOpen Money is not about having an extreme position. Instead, it's the middle way.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe main advantage of having an alternative financial system that works parallel to the establishment is that it offers a different kind of fulcrum to hold things in balance, especially during disruption or chaos.</p>\n<p>\\\nOpen Money is a means of navigating the extremes of our times and building personal financial and information products that provide individual control and more global access (sometimes simultaneously).</p>\n<p>\\\nBut as crypto becomes part of the establishment, will it lose part of its utility?</p>\n<h2 id=\"usecaseambiguityasanasset\">Use Case Ambiguity as an Asset</h2>\n<p>Not that long ago, it was easier to understand crypto—or at least what it wasn't.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe early adopters and builders were generally interested in creating alternatives. The narratives in the early years were positioned in opposition to the status quo.</p>\n<p>\\\nInterestingly, in the last 12 to 18 months, crypto has started to feel more like a new product line in the legacy system rather than something completely different.</p>\n<p>\\\nHere are just a few examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.danielmcglynn.com/why-the-bitcoin-etf-approval-matters-sliced-three-ways/\">launch and demand for crypto ETFs</a> and the arrival of institutional money.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Crypto as part of presidential politics — and crypto leaders and influencers embracing the attention of political leaders.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Crypto has mainstream moments — <a href=\"https://www.danielmcglynn.com/whats-next-for-prediction-markets/\">crypto-based prediction markets</a> compete with legacy media during the presidential election cycle.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nWhile all of that is underway, there's also a sense that the best of crypto—the people, developers, and teams pushing the bounds of what's possible—will always need to operate at the edges.</p>\n<h2 id=\"openmoneyagainstahedgeagainstinsert\">Open Money Against a Hedge Against [/insert]</h2>\n<p>It's that time of year when people start to get both reflective and forward-looking simultaneously.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn my case, looking at headlines about the appointment of a new crypto czar, the power of the freshly organized crypto lobby, and whether or not the incoming SEC chair has enough crypto experience (or not), it's stunning to see how quickly crypto has moved from fringe to spotlight.</p>\n<p>\\\nAnd yet, somehow, it feels like a pivot towards \"legitimacy\" is missing the point. It feels important not to get wrapped up in it all—and not to create another \"too big to fail\" situation at the cost of losing the plot.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe world is changing.</p>\n<p>\\\nAnd it's changing fast.</p>\n<p>\\\nAlternatives, backups, and systems that can scale from the individual to the global are a good idea.</p>\n<p>\\\nWe've covered how the <a href=\"https://www.danielmcglynn.com/what-comes-after-the-end-of-the-world/\">big shifts in demographics, information technology, and economics will accelerate change</a> and how decentralized, permissionless, and non-custodial assets will become even more important in the future.</p>\n<p>\\\nCrypto when deployed at scale, has the capacity to address some of the world’s biggest biggest risks including digital access and digital equity.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe world is undergoing massive changes that will affect how we organize and coordinate.

Users like me, who set a BIOS and storage password, have to stay on the screen to enter the required password so that the process can be  completed quickly.</p>\n<p>\\\nUpdates are often given for our benefit, usually arriving with the latest features, improvements, and fixes. However, it’s common for updates to mistakenly roll out with some problems that can negatively affect the experience and performance.</p>\n<p>\\\nSo, first, you have to go through a frustrating update process, and if the update comes out with some bugs or issues, you then need to get a  gear and debug the system, which could have been avoided if the Windows 11 update was disabled permanently.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn this quick guide, I’ll show you different ways to disable Windows 11 auto updates permanently.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Note</strong>: First, you should never disable auto-updates  for Windows Server, especially security updates, and second, there is no permanent workaround to disable Windows 11 auto-updates, but you can  modify the Group Policy or Registry to disable auto-updates, while still  being able to install updates manually.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"method1disableautomaticupdatesonwindows11fromsettings\">Method 1: Disable Automatic Updates on Windows 11 From Settings</h2>\n<p>This method is a temporary, not permanent, solution; it is the first suggested method because it doesn’t require modifying any system  configuration files and can be done entirely from the Windows settings.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo temporarily disable Windows 11 automatic updates, follow these instructions:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open “<strong>Settings</strong>” in Windows 11.</li>\n<li>Navigate to “<strong>Windows Update.</strong>“</li>\n<li>Turn off “<em>Get the latest updates as soon as they’re available</em>” under “<strong>More options.</strong>“</li>\n<li>Click the “<em>Pause for 1 week</em>” button next to “<strong>Pause updates</strong>” to pause the update for 1 week (it can be paused for a maximum of 5 weeks).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-kt02q13.webp\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nOnce the process is complete, the Windows 11 auto-update will be paused for one week or until you click the “<strong>Resume updates</strong>” button in the top right corner.</p>\n<h2 id=\"method2blockautomaticdownloadforaspecificupdate\">Method 2: Block Automatic Download for a Specific Update</h2>\n<p>Windows 11 updates are often automatically downloaded in the  background, but if you want to prevent a particular update from  downloading on Windows 11, follow these steps.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>First, download the “<strong><a href=\"https://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab\">Windows Show or Hide Updates</a></strong>” diagnostic troubleshooting file.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p>Double-click the downloaded file and then click on the “<strong>Next</strong>” button.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-8n12qlr.webp\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Click the “<strong>Hide updates</strong>” button.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-9i22qdq.webp\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Select the Windows 11 update or driver to block.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-2h32qef.webp\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>After that, click the “<strong>Next</strong>” button and close the window.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\nThis will stop the automatic download of that specific update or driver, but it will still download and install a newer version when it becomes available.</p>\n<h2 id=\"method3disableautomaticupdatesonwindows11fromgrouppolicy\">Method 3: Disable Automatic Updates on Windows 11 From Group Policy</h2>\n<p>The previous two methods temporarily disabled Windows updates. However, by editing certain rules in the Group Policy Editor, you can  effectively disable automatic updates permanently on Windows 11. Note that this method is only applicable to Windows 11 Pro; for Windows 11  Home, which lacks this tool, you can use the Registry method instead.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo disable the automatic updates permanently on Windows 11 Pro from Group Policy, follow these instructions.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Open the “<strong>Group Policy Editor</strong>” by searching for “<strong>gpedit</strong>” and clicking on the first result, or by running “<em>gpedit.msc</em>” in the “<strong>Run</strong>” window.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p>Navigate to the “<strong>Computer Configuration</strong>” -&gt; “<strong>Administrative Templates</strong>” -&gt; “<strong>Windows Components</strong>” -&gt; “<strong>Windows Update</strong>” -&gt; “<strong>Manage end user experience.</strong>“</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p>Double-click to open the <strong>“Configure Automatic Updates”</strong> policy.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-xm42qe9.webp\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Choose the “<strong>Disabled</strong>” option, and click the “<strong>Ok</strong>” button to disable automatic Windows 11 updates permanently.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-hl52q4m.webp\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nOnce the process is complete, automatic updates for Windows 11 will be permanently disabled, but you can still manually check for updates  through Windows settings.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo re-enable the automatic update, just follow the same instructions, but in “<strong>step 4</strong>“, ensure you choose the “<strong>Not Configured</strong>” option.</p>\n<h2 id=\"method4disableautomaticupdatesonwindows11fromtheregistry\">Method 4: Disable Automatic Updates on Windows 11 from the Registry</h2>\n<p>Unlike the previous method, this will work on both Windows 11 Home  and Pro. So, to disable the automatic updates permanently on Windows 11  from the registry, follow these instructions.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Open the “<strong>Registry Editor</strong>” by searching for “<strong>regedit</strong>” and clicking on the first result, or by running “<em>regedit</em>” in the “<strong>Run</strong>” window.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p>Navigate to the “<em>HKEY<em>LOCAL</em>MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate\\AU</em>” path.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p>Right-click on the “<strong>AU</strong>” key (or folder), select “<strong>New</strong>” from the context menu, and then choose the “<strong>DWORD (32-bit) Value</strong>” option.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\n\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-r862q0n.webp\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><p>Name the key “<strong>NoAutoUpdate</strong>” and press “<strong>Enter.</strong>“</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p>Double-click the newly created key, and change its value from “<strong>0</strong>” to “<strong>1.</strong>“</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-ru72qln.webp\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Click the “<strong>OK</strong>” button, and restart the computer system to apply the changes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\\\nOnce the process is complete and the system is booted, there will be no automatic updates in the future unless the user manually initiates an  update. If you want to revert the change, simply follow the same instructions, just make sure to change the value to “<strong>0</strong>” in step 5.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapup\">Wrap Up</h2>\n<p>Windows updates are often criticized for their approach to rebooting the system to complete the process. However, there is no way yet to  update the Windows system without rebooting, so if you are managing a Windows server system, you must go through this annoying process.</p>\n<p>\\\nHowever, if you are an end user who uses a PC for normal tasks, you can skip updating the system and continue to use it unless your system  is connected to the internet, as updates ensure protection from the latest spyware, malware, and trojans.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf you want my suggestion, I personally recommend using the first  method in the article to pause updates for a week and then take all  updates in one go.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Could Marvel Rivals Help Facilitate Better US-China Relations?","url":"https://hackernoon.com/could-marvel-rivals-help-facilitate-better-us-china-relations?source=rss","date":1733793209,"author":"Jabril Goodner","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p><em>Marvel Rivals,</em>&nbsp;released on December 6, 2024, on Xbox, PC, and PlayStation, is the latest entry in the hero shooter genre. While&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>&nbsp;has long dominated this space, it may be time for a new chaotic, team-based game to take the spotlight.</p>\n<h1 id=\"eastandwestsynergy\">East and West Synergy</h1>\n<p>Developed by gaming giant NetEase Games, headquartered in Guangzhou, China, with offices in Seattle, the game utilizes iconic Marvel superheroes like Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Captain America, while also allowing players to team up with villains like Venom, Magneto, and Loki in action-packed, colorful 6v6 arenas. </p>\n<p>\\\nThe game boasts excellent sound design, well-crafted maps, and simple gameplay that players familiar with the genre will quickly pick up. Being a third-person shooter,&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>&nbsp;showcases each Marvel legend in their iconic glory. Each character stays true to their source material, offering expressive, engaging designs that are fun to watch and play.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhat stands out most to me, beyond the captivating gameplay and vibrant art style, is the potential for Western and Eastern audiences to come together through characters beloved for over 60 years. Spider-Man, the Hulk — these are universally recognized figures. Even though the characters were created in America, the Marvel Universe enjoys a massive following in China, highlighted by the&nbsp;<em>Marvel Universe</em>&nbsp;attraction at Shanghai Disneyland.</p>\n<p>\\\nChina is the largest gaming market in the world, making the financial incentive for a game like&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>&nbsp;undeniable. With dedicated servers globally, the game has strong potential to unite Eastern and Western communities while fostering competition through esports. </p>\n<p>\\\nAlthough we don’t yet know the full roadmap for competitive esports within the game, the Marvel trademark could prove invaluable in securing big prize pools that entice players to compete for trophies and profit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/8NUtV1CkyKs?embedable=true\">https://youtu.be/8NUtV1CkyKs?embedable=true</a></p>\n<p>The inclusion of Tokyo-themed stages in the game is a nice touch, drawing attention to the world’s love of Japanese culture and appealing to Marvel’s Japanese fanbase. If NetEase manages this project well,&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>&nbsp;could become one of the biggest games, connecting Western and Eastern fanbases, casual players, and aspiring professionals alike. </p>\n<p>\\\nPerhaps we’ll even see Chinese players gain recognition in the West for their incredible gameplay as Rocket Raccoon or Iron Man. The game even features some Chinese writing, which has left some players confused. This inclusion of Chinese characters is likely part of a broader strategy to celebrate and bring attention to Chinese culture and artists.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-1l1360x.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h1 id=\"privacyconcernsandpoliticalimplications\"><strong>Privacy Concerns and Political Implications</strong></h1>\n<p>If you’ve been following the news, you might know that TikTok faces a potential ban at the beginning of 2025 due to “national security” risks. I wonder if&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>&nbsp;and NetEase will face similar scrutiny regarding privacy concerns, given that the company is based in China. Such accusations could have significant implications for the future of gaming.</p>\n<p>\\\nIt’s already well-known that games today collect vast amounts of data on players. Perhaps this concern is premature, but it’s worth considering how technologies influence public relations and politics. Still, I believe accusations of serious privacy violations or concerns about how a Chinese company uses player data will likely go ignored. Most players care little about the political and economic implications of games as long as their gameplay isn’t affected or the costs of in-game cosmetics and DLC don’t rise. </p>\n<p>\\\nOf course, there have been instances where politics, activism, and esports have collided. The more connected the world becomes, the more issues are spotlighted and shared.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-f6236i4.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h1 id=\"questionsforthefuture\"><strong>Questions for the Future</strong></h1>\n<p>How will NetEase’s origins impact its ability to secure sponsorships? How much will China’s gaming industry invest in making&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>&nbsp;a viable product in the competitive gaming space? Will international teams be brought in? Could major players in esports, like Saudi Arabia, get involved?</p>\n<p>\\\nThere’s potential for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>&nbsp;to feature at the World Esports Cup in 2025, but many questions remain. Nevertheless, this game could serve as a valuable tool to unite global gaming culture and add fuel to the rapidly growing esports machine.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>China has actively promoted the global dissemination of its games as a cultural export, with several games enjoying major success abroad.

Yet, many companies overlook one of the simplest and most cost-effective ways to boost their SEO and user engagement: internal linking. By adopting a quarterly internal linking strategy, you can refine your site structure, prioritize key pages, and guide prospects seamlessly along the buyer’s journey.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf you’re ready to transform internal links from an afterthought into a strategic asset, this guide will walk you through actionable steps to audit your existing links, maximize the impact of high-performing pages, and align your linking strategy with your growth goals.</p>\n<p>\\\nBe sure to also check out my recent article, <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/future-proof-your-marketing-with-this-guide-on-writing-for-ai-search-engines\">\"Future-Proof Your Marketing With This Guide on Writing for AI Search Engines,\"</a> where I explore optimizing content for the evolving search landscape.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"quarterlyinternallinkingstrategiesforseo\"><strong>Quarterly Internal Linking Strategies for SEO</strong></h2>\n<p>Internal linking is one of the most overlooked yet powerful SEO tactics available to B2B companies. A robust internal linking strategy does more than improve your website’s discoverability—it builds a seamless user experience that prioritizes your highest-value content and nurtures leads through the buyer’s journey.</p>\n<p>\\\nImplementing a quarterly review ensures your internal linking strategy remains fresh and impactful, even as your site grows. Here's how to do it step-by-step:</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"auditexistinglinks\"><strong>Audit Existing Links</strong></h3>\n<p>An audit lays the foundation for effective internal linking. Start by analyzing your existing links with these three key actions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Identify Broken Links: Broken links harm both user experience and SEO rankings. Replace or remove these to maintain credibility and keep users engaged.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p>Update Outdated Links: Pages that no longer reflect your latest offerings or insights need fresh links. Ensure internal links guide users to the most current and relevant content.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n<li><p>Add Links to Underserved Pages: Some pages, especially newer ones, might lack internal links. Adding these can help search engines index them faster while improving their visibility.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"identifyhighperformingpages\"><strong>Identify High-Performing Pages</strong></h3>\n<p>Not all pages on your website hold equal weight. Focus your internal linking efforts on pages that deliver the most value based on engagement metrics. Prioritize:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>High Conversion Rates:</strong> Pages that drive significant lead generation or sales.</li>\n<li><strong>High Lead Attribution:</strong> Content responsible for progressing leads down the funnel.</li>\n<li><strong>High Organic Traffic:</strong> Pages that already perform well in search engines, as they’re prime candidates for linking to additional content.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"mapoutanchortext\"><strong>Map Out Anchor Text</strong></h3>\n<p>Anchor text is a critical component of internal linking, both for users and search engines. When mapping anchor text, consider the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use Long-Tail Keywords:</strong> These make the anchor text descriptive and naturally conversational.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid Exact-Match Spam:</strong> Overusing exact-match keywords can trigger penalties from search engines. Balance relevance with variety.</li>\n<li><strong>Align Anchor Text with Intent:</strong> Ensure the text reflects the page it links to, setting clear expectations for users.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"linktonewcontent\"><strong>Link to New Content</strong></h3>\n<p>As your website grows from content marketing efforts, linking to new content is essential to keep users engaged and highlight fresh resources. Focus on linking from:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Top-Performing Pages:</strong> Pages with high traffic or conversions can drive attention to newer, complementary content.</li>\n<li><strong>Relevant Product or Service Pages:</strong> Cross-linking blog content to product pages provides context and drives intent.</li>\n<li><strong>Related Articles:</strong> Building topic clusters by interlinking related blog posts enhances user experience and search engine understanding.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"updatelinksonhightrafficpages\"><strong>Update Links on High-Traffic Pages</strong></h3>\n<p>Your most-visited pages are prime real estate for internal links. These might include blogs, case studies, or videos. Regularly review these pages to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Highlight newer resources that complement their content.</li>\n<li>Ensure the links align with current customer pain points or questions.</li>\n<li>Use them strategically to guide visitors through your ideal buyer journey.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"whyaquarterlyreview\"><strong>Why a Quarterly Review?</strong></h3>\n<p>SEO is dynamic, and so is your business.

Leetcode contests are perfect for those who want a grip on their DSA concepts and want to experience competitive pressure. Now, you might be thinking, “Do we really need to read this article and who’s this person?”</p>\n<p>\\\nSo, I must tell you that I have been coding properly for like past 6–7 months only. I started Leetcode contests probably in like September of last year. Since then, I have given almost all the contests, and it took me just 15 contests to get into the top 3% of Leetcoders. You can do the same with a little bit of dedication and motivation. Just keep these points in mind:</p>\n<h3 id=\"dontmisscontests\"><strong>Don’t Miss Contests</strong></h3>\n<p>No matter if you are busy with your exams or day-to-day work, you must take some of your time and give it to the contest.&nbsp;Leetcode Biweekly contests are held alternating Saturdays at 8 pm IST, and Weekly contests are held every Sunday at 8 am IST.&nbsp;If by any chance you missed any contest, attempt a virtual contest. Virtual contests give you an idea of what your ranking would be, but it will not change your rating.</p>\n<h3 id=\"upsolveproblems\"><strong>Upsolve Problems</strong></h3>\n<p>Generally, people participate and then post contests that don’t try to solve unsolved problems or try to find a more optimized approach for the problem they have solved. Note this: if you do not upsolve, you can’t learn anything from the contest.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Those who don’t learn from their mistakes are&nbsp;bound&nbsp;to repeat them.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\\\nLike if you have solved A and B&nbsp;questions. Then give one day to review the solutions you have solved and one day to solve the C and D questions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"topicstocover\"><strong>Topics to Cover</strong></h3>\n<p>Contests on platforms like Leetcode, GeeksForGeeks(GFG), and CodeStudio are more based on DSA and not on competitive concepts. So for these contests, you should have a good grip on below mentioned topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Arrays</p></li>\n<li><p>Linked&nbsp;Lists</p></li>\n<li><p>Stack/Queue/Priority Queue</p></li>\n<li><p>Trees: Traversal questions and the DFS approach are important</p></li>\n<li><p>Graphs: Graph algorithms like Dijkstra and Floyd Warshall are important.</p></li>\n<li><p>Greedy Algorithm</p></li>\n<li><p>Dynamic Programming</p></li>\n<li><p>Union Find</p></li>\n<li><p>Two Pointer Approach</p></li>\n<li><p>Sliding Window</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hold on; Trees, Graphs, and Dynamic Programming take time. These are a bit lengthy topics and need more practice.</p>\n<p>\\\nRefer to my curated repository for topic-wise codes for various problems and concepts.</p>\n<p>\\\nP.S: First try to solve the problem on&nbsp;your&nbsp;own.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<p>:::tip\nFollow: <a href=\"https://github.com/Kanav-Arora/DSA-Guide\">https://github.com/Kanav-Arora/DSA-Guide</a> for DSA Roadmap and Solutions.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<h3 id=\"dontdirectlyjumptothesolution\"><strong>Don’t Directly Jump to the Solution</strong></h3>\n<p>This is one of the most important points. Directly jumping to the solution makes you handicapped and will not improve your problem approachability. First, give it a thought, and try to dry-run your solutions on given test cases. Solve it on a paper and then submit it. Then only should you consider looking for the solution. </p>\n<p>\\\nNow, the most common mistake people make is they prefer text solutions over video solutions but text solutions can’t have that much of an understanding. You need to get the intuition of the problem so that you can solve it again on your own.</p>\n<p>\\\nBelieve it or not, Leetcode problems are the same or somewhat similar to the interview problems. So, you must solve these if you are appearing for a tech interview.</p>\n<p>\\\nThanks for reading! If you like the article, please give it a clap👏, and follow the publication for more such stories.

From a report: Drylands now make up 40% of all land on Earth, excluding Antarctica. Three-quarters of the world's land suffered drier conditions in the past 30 years, which is likely to be permanent, according to the study by the UN Science Policy Interface, a body of scientists convened by the United Nations. \n\nAfrica lost about 12% of its GDP owing to the increasing aridity between 1990 and 2015, the report found. Even worse losses are forecast: Africa will lose about 16% of its GDP, and Asia close to 7%, in the next half decade. Ibrahim Thiaw, executive secretary of the UN convention to combat desertification (UNCCD), said: \"Unlike droughts -- temporary periods of low rainfall -- aridity represents a permanent, unrelenting transformation. Droughts end. When an area's climate becomes drier, however, the ability to return to previous conditions is lost. The drier climates now affecting vast lands across the globe will not return to how they were, and this change is redefining life on Earth.\" \n\nSome crops will be particularly at risk: maize yields are projected to halve in Kenya by 2050, if current trends continue. Drylands are areas where 90% of the rainfall is lost to evaporation, leaving only 10% for vegetation. Two-thirds of land globally will store less water by mid-century, according to the report published on Monday.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Drylands+Now+Make+Up+40%25+of+Land+on+Earth%2C+Excluding+Antarctica%2C+Study+Says%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F10%2F0357259%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F10%2F0357259%2Fdrylands-now-make-up-40-of-land-on-earth-excluding-antarctica-study-says%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/10/0357259/drylands-now-make-up-40-of-land-on-earth-excluding-antarctica-study-says?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23546883&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Gen Z VCs CEO & Founder Speaks on Revolutionizing Venture Capital for the Next Generation","url":"https://hackernoon.com/gen-z-vcs-ceo-and-founder-speaks-on-revolutionizing-venture-capital-for-the-next-generation?source=rss","date":1733807783,"author":"NewsByte.Tech","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"hackernoonwhatisyourcompanyin25words\">HackerNoon: What is your company in 2–5 words?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.meaganloyst.com/\">Meagan Loyst</a>: Community for next-gen innovators.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"whyisnowthetimeforyourcompanytoexist\">Why is now the time for your company to exist?</h3>\n<p>Gen Z is coming into our peak spending/working years and we want to make an impact in several areas of our lives -- venture capital and entrepreneurship are two ways to do exactly that, creating impact at scale by founding and investing in the companies of the future that we'll interact with every day… in healthcare, education, finance, tech, climate, and beyond.

China State Railway Group, the national operator, has accumulated nearly $1 trillion in debt and liabilities, requiring $25 billion annually for debt service. \n\nDespite this, plans call for adding 15,000 more miles by 2035. While flagship routes between major cities like Beijing and Shanghai remain profitable, newer lines into rural regions are struggling with low ridership. In Sichuan province's Fushun County, which received high-speed rail service in 2021, stations built for thousands sit largely empty despite having 12 high-speed rail stops within a 40-mile radius. \n\nThe expansion has become a symbol of China's technological advancement but raises concerns about economic viability. Ticket prices are maintained at about one-quarter of global averages to ensure public access, limiting profit potential. The railway operator turned a modest $460 million profit in 2023, aided by government subsidies, after three years of losses during the pandemic.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=China's+Trillion-Dollar+Bet+on+High-Speed+Rail+Transformation%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F10%2F0634232%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F10%2F0634232%2Fchinas-trillion-dollar-bet-on-high-speed-rail-transformation%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/12/10/0634232/chinas-trillion-dollar-bet-on-high-speed-rail-transformation?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23546983&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Let's Build a Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor Using My Web App Framework of Choice","url":"https://hackernoon.com/lets-build-a-real-time-collaborative-document-editor-using-my-web-app-framework-of-choice?source=rss","date":1733813031,"author":"Mr. Ånand","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<h3 id=\"tldr\">TL;DR</h3>\n<p>Learn how to build a secure, real-time collaborative document editor with Next.js, Appwrite, Liveblocks, and Permit.io using ReBAC for flexible and secure relationship-based access control.</p>\n<p>\\\nFeatures include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Real-time collaboration</strong> with presence awareness.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Secure storage</strong> and login management.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Scalable permissions</strong> for complex access needs.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This guide offers a strong foundation for building advanced collaborative tools.

These platforms simplify working together, but they also introduce challenges like ensuring the right people have the right access without compromising sensitive information. That’s where proper access control comes into play.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn this guide, we will build a collaborative document editor using Next.js for the front end, Appwrite for authentication and storage, Liveblocks for smooth collaboration, and Permit.io to manage advanced authorization with Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC).</p>\n<h3 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h3>\n<p>Before we start, make sure you have these tools installed on your computer</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Node.js (v18 or later)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Npm (v10 or later)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nYou should also know the basics of React and TypeScript, as we’ll be using them in this tutorial.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toolswewillnbspuse\">Tools we will&nbsp;use</h2>\n<p>To build the real-time collaborative document editor, we will use the following tools. Let’s discuss their purpose and how they work together.</p>\n<h3 id=\"appwrite\">Appwrite</h3>\n<p>Appwrite is an open-source backend-as-a-service platform that offers solutions for authentication, databases, functions, storage, and messaging for your projects using the frameworks and languages you prefer. In this tutorial, we will use its authentication and storage solutions for user login/signup and to store the document content.</p>\n<h3 id=\"liveblocks\">Liveblocks</h3>\n<p>Liveblocks is a platform that lets you add collaborative editing, comments, and notifications to your app. It offers a set of tools that you can use to include collaboration features, so you can pick what you need based on your needs.</p>\n<p>\\\nLiveblocks works well with popular frontend frameworks and libraries, making it easy to quickly add real-time collaboration to any application.</p>\n<h3 id=\"permitiohttpswwwpermitio\"><a href=\"https://www.permit.io/\">Permit.io</a></h3>\n<p>Building authorization logic from scratch takes a lot of time. Permit.io makes this easier by providing a simple interface to manage permissions separately from your code. This keeps your access rules organized, simplifies management, and reduces the effort needed to maintain your code.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn this tutorial, we will use Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC), an authorization model that is more flexible than traditional role-based access control. ReBAC allows you to set access rules based on the relationships between users and resources. For our document editor, this means we can easily set up permissions like:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Document owners have full control over their documents</p></li>\n<li><p>Editors are able to change content but not delete the document</p></li>\n<li><p>Viewers having read-only access</p>\n<p>\\\n<img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-jc12nq5.png\" alt=\"\" /></p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"nextjs\">Next.js</h3>\n<p><strong>Next.js</strong> is a popular framework for building server-side rendered web applications quickly and efficiently.

If they are, it will render the children.

In the request, we get user details, the active roomId, and permissions (from&nbsp;<strong>Permit.io</strong>, which we’ll discuss soon). We use the Liveblocks client’s&nbsp;<code>prepareSession</code>&nbsp;method to create the session with the user's unique ID and some extra information (used to display the live cursor and user avatars in the editor).</p>\n<p>\\\nWe then check if the user has read or update permissions and add the appropriate room permission, either&nbsp;<code>room:read</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>room:write</code>. Finally, we call the&nbsp;<code>session.allow</code>&nbsp;method with the roomId and permissions list, and then authorize it to generate a unique token.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>For&nbsp;<strong>userInfo</strong>, we can only pass the name and color attributes because we have defined only those attributes in liveblocks.config.ts.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\\\nAlright, now let’s create a&nbsp;<code>LiveblocksWrapper</code>&nbsp;component and use the endpoint we made.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">// components/editor/liveblocks-wrapper.tsx\n\n'use client';\n\nimport {\n  ClientSideSuspense,\n  LiveblocksProvider,\n  RoomProvider,\n} from '@liveblocks/react/suspense';\nimport Loader from '../loader';\nimport { PermissionType } from '@/app/actions';\nimport { useAuthStore } from '@/store/authStore';\n\ninterface LiveblocksWrapperProps {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n  roomId: string;\n  permissions: Record&lt;PermissionType, boolean&gt;;\n}\n\nexport default function LiveblocksWrapper({\n  children,\n  roomId,\n  permissions,\n}: Readonly&lt;LiveblocksWrapperProps&gt;) {\n  const { user } = useAuthStore();\n\n  return (\n    &lt;LiveblocksProvider\n      authEndpoint={async (room) =&gt; {\n        const response = await fetch('/api/liveblock-session', {\n          method: 'POST',\n          headers: {\n            'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n          },\n          body: JSON.stringify({\n            user: user,\n            roomId: roomId,\n            room,\n            permissions,\n          }),\n        });\n\n        return await response.json();\n      }}\n    &gt;\n      &lt;RoomProvider\n        id={roomId}\n        initialPresence={{\n          cursor: null,\n        }}\n      &gt;\n        &lt;ClientSideSuspense fallback={&lt;Loader /&gt;}&gt;\n          {children}\n        &lt;/ClientSideSuspense&gt;\n      &lt;/RoomProvider&gt;\n    &lt;/LiveblocksProvider&gt;\n  );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nHere, we use the&nbsp;<code>LiveblocksProvider</code>&nbsp;from the Liveblocks package, which takes&nbsp;<code>authEndpoint</code>&nbsp;as a prop. We call the&nbsp;<code>'/api/liveblock-session'</code>&nbsp;endpoint with the user, roomId, and permissions. Next, we use&nbsp;<code>RoomProvider</code>&nbsp;to create a separate space for collaboration. It takes two props:&nbsp;<code>id</code>&nbsp;(roomId) and&nbsp;<code>initialPresence</code>&nbsp;(to show the active user's cursor in the editor).</p>\n<p>\\\n<code>ClientSideSuspense</code>&nbsp;is used to display a fallback until the room is ready.</p>\n<p>\\\nGreat, we have the LiveblocksWrapper ready. Now, let’s use it on the document page.

Based on our findings, the&nbsp;<code>nuc</code>&nbsp;lang helps Neural Networks to abstract patterns, which is eventually used in Symbolic System, and Knowledge Graph is built with logic and data representations in the intermediate language. In addition, LLMs surprisingly behave near deterministic while running on ARC-AGI.</p>\n<p>\\\nBefore diving into our approach:</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisarcbenchmark\">What is ARC Benchmark?</h2>\n<p>The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is a benchmark dataset and challenge designed to test AGI systems on their ability to perform human-like reasoning and abstraction. Developed by François Chollet, ARC is not a typical machine learning dataset—it intentionally avoids tasks solvable by brute-force statistical techniques or large-scale data training.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ZfW2FmULqJg70a4vxjbep3OZIBf1-jv034vu.png\" alt=\"ARC Puzzle\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"ourprogress\">Our Progress 🐋</h3>\n<p>We were able to get very promising and exciting numbers (Still incomplete tho). For example, in this puzzle, our project responded with this result&nbsp;<strong>without any prompt engineering.</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nMore details here 👇 \\n <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/NucleoidAI/Nucleoid/tree/main/arc\">https://github.com/NucleoidAI/Nucleoid/tree/main/arc</a></strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ZfW2FmULqJg70a4vxjbep3OZIBf1-0v134s7.png\" alt=\"nuc Response\" /></p>\n<p>…and this is ChatGPT o-1's answer</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ZfW2FmULqJg70a4vxjbep3OZIBf1-4x234fr.png\" alt=\"ChatGPT o-1 Response\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisneurosymbolicai\">🌱 What is Neuro-Symbolic AI?</h2>\n<p>Neuro-Symbolic AI combines the pattern-recognition capabilities of neural networks (subsymbolic AI) with the logical reasoning and structured knowledge of symbolic AI to create robust and versatile systems. Neural networks excel at learning from unstructured data, like images or text, while symbolic AI handles explicit rules and reasoning, offering transparency and precision. By integrating these approaches, Neuro-Symbolic AI enables generalization from smaller datasets, improves explainability, and supports tasks requiring both adaptability and logical consistency. This hybrid approach is pivotal for advancing AGI, as it bridges the gap between learning from data and reasoning through.</p>\n<h3 id=\"system1andsystem2\">🌍 System 1 and System 2</h3>\n<p>Neuro-Symbolic AI aligns intriguingly with the concepts from Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow, which describes two systems of human thought: System 1 (fast, intuitive, and automatic) and System 2 (slow, deliberate, and logical).</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Neural Networks in Neuro-Symbolic AI parallel System 1, as they excel at processing unstructured data, recognizing patterns, and generating outputs rapidly without explicit reasoning. They mimic intuitive, subconscious processes that are data-driven and reactive.</li>\n<li>Symbolic AI, on the other hand, mirrors System 2, as it relies on explicit rules, logic, and structured reasoning to solve problems in a deliberate and explainable manner, akin to conscious, rational thought.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nBy combining these two paradigms, Neuro-Symbolic AI reflects the dual systems of human cognition, enabling it to tackle problems requiring both fast intuition (pattern recognition) and slow reasoning (logic and planning). This hybrid approach not only enhances AI's adaptability but also brings it closer to human-like intelligence by integrating the strengths of both modes of thought.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ducktest\">🦆 Duck Test</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ZfW2FmULqJg70a4vxjbep3OZIBf1-3h33498.gif.webp\" alt=\"Duck Test\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n\"If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck\"</p>\n<p>\\\nSimply, it is System 1 at work. We have seen ducks probably thousands or millions of times throughout our lives, which forms well-defined patterns in our cognition. When we come across something resembling a duck, human cognition doesn’t trigger System 2 because identifying the object as a duck is automatic and intuitive. Our brains rely on a mental \"duck schema\" even the individual parts of a duck, such as its wings, bill, or webbed feet, are matched to their associated labels in realm of System 1.</p>\n<h3 id=\"duckinthelake\">Duck in the Lake</h3>\n<p>Again, we won't be surprised if we seen duck in the lake, because we have enough labelled patterns to make the call.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ZfW2FmULqJg70a4vxjbep3OZIBf1-3f434dr.png\" alt=\"Duck in the Lake\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"duckinthecity\">Duck in the City</h3>\n<p>In this case, as our experiences typically associate ducks with natural settings, it is uncommon to see a duck in an urban environment at night. This unfamiliarity triggers System 2 to take over, engaging in more deliberate reasoning. So, System 2 is now responsible for reasoning as cities being dangerous after dark, and the duck is in the city, duck may not be safe. System 2 overrides System 1’s instinctive identification of \"a duck\" and shifts the focus to evaluating the broader circumstances of the duck's well-being.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ZfW2FmULqJg70a4vxjbep3OZIBf1-dn534q5.png\" alt=\"Duck in the City\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"cpuvsgpu\">CPU vs GPU</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/ZfW2FmULqJg70a4vxjbep3OZIBf1-ls63466.gif.webp\" alt=\"CPU vs GPU\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nNeuro-Symbolic AI architecture orchestrates a seamless harmony between the precision of CPUs in reasoning and the raw power of GPUs in pattern recognition.</p>\n<p>\\\nCPUs are specialized in logical branch operations used in decision-making, and GPUs execute parallel arithmetic operations for matrix multiplications in pattern recognition. So, it is important to understand how they are different.</p>\n<p>\\\nCPUs are designed for versatility, with fewer cores optimized for high-performance single-threaded tasks and low latency, making them well-suited for complex decision-making, sequential processing, and multitasking. In contrast, GPUs have thousands of smaller, energy-efficient cores optimized for massive parallelism, enabling them to handle tasks like matrix computations, image rendering, and deep learning efficiently. GPUs excel in throughput-oriented tasks where large data sets can be processed simultaneously, while CPUs focus on general-purpose computing and running the operating system. Additionally, CPUs often feature larger caches and more sophisticated control logic to handle diverse workloads, whereas GPUs prioritize raw computational power and bandwidth to accelerate specific workloads. This fundamental difference makes GPUs indispensable for tasks requiring high parallelism, while CPUs remain the backbone of general computing and coordination.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhile building a modular AI system, it is crucial to design with the underlying hardware in mind. In advanced systems like AIs, hardware constraints can sometimes conflict with algorithmic requirements. In Neuro-Symbolic standpoint, Neural Network (System 1) needs GPU for pattern recognition and CPUs for knowledge representation and reasoning in Symbolic (System 2). It is worth noting, System 1 and 2 is just for building AI foundation, expecting more and more systems like them…</p>\n<p>\\\nIn short, it is not possible doing efficient reasoning with GPU or pattern recognition with using CPU.</p>\n<p>\\\n🌿 Stay Tuned for Recap 02 in Road<em>to</em>AGI series…</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2Arjj6LV5M&ab_channel=NucleoidAI&embedable=true\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2Arjj6LV5M&ab_channel=NucleoidAI&embedable=true</a></p>\n<p>\\</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Every Reason You Should be Getting Started With .Net Aspire","url":"https://hackernoon.com/every-reason-you-should-be-getting-started-with-net-aspire?source=rss","date":1733816692,"author":"Simon Foster","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>.Net Aspire is a comprehensive set of tools, templates, and packages designed to simplify the development of cloud-native applications using .Net.

It has a Blazor web front end, it communicates with a .Net API and that API retrieves data from a SQL Server database. Before Aspire came along I would create a docker compose file and configure ports so the FE could call the API, and add connection strings so the API could access the database.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"yaml language-yaml\">services:\n  Api:\n    image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}api\n    container_name: api\n    ports:\n      - 12345:80\n      - 44338:443\n    networks:\n      - my-network\n    build:\n      context: .\n      dockerfile: API/Dockerfile\n    depends_on:\n      - sqlserver\n\n  Ui:\n    image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}ui\n    container_name: ui\n    ports:\n      - 44330:443\n    networks:\n      - my-network\n    build:\n      context: .\n      dockerfile: UI/Dockerfile\n    environment:\n      - APIPath=http://Api:80\n\n  sqlserver:\n    image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}sql\n    container_name: sql\n    volumes:\n      - sqlvol:/var/opt/mssql\n    ports:\n      - \"5432:1433\"\n    networks:\n      - my-network\n    build:\n      context: .\n      dockerfile: Database/Dockerfile\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nAs you can see from this docker compose file, there is a lot of specifying ports and other plumbing to get these three parts of my system to work together.</p>\n<p>\\\nNow in Visual Studio, right-click on the API project and select add&nbsp;<strong>.Net Aspire Orchestrator Support</strong>&nbsp;this will add two new Visual Studio projects to the solution, AppHost and ServiceDefaults.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AppHost is where you configure what service depends on what, you can configure all sorts of different dependencies, like databases (sql server, mysql, postgres etc), rabbitmq, redis and many others.</li>\n<li>ServiceDefaults is where you configure the defaults for your services, like how opentelemetry should be configured, or how logging should work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nNow right click on the Blazor project and select the same option to get that wired up as well.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"csharp language-csharp\">var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\nbuilder.AddProject&lt;Projects.UI&gt;(\"ui\");\n\nbuilder.AddProject&lt;Projects.API&gt;(\"api\");\n\nbuilder.Build().Run();\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nYour Program.cs file inside your AppHost project will look something like this now, with both your API and UI/Blazor projects referenced.</p>\n<p>\\\nThere is one more component we need to wire up, but we don’t have a project to right click on for the database. It is fairly straightforward to do, update it to look like the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"csharp language-csharp\">var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\nvar sqldb = builder.AddSqlServer(\"sql\")\n    .WithDataVolume(\"sql-data\")\n    .AddDatabase(\"Context\", \"Project\");\n\nvar api = builder.AddProject&lt;Projects.API&gt;(\"api\")\n    .WaitFor(sqldb)\n    .WithReference(sqldb);\n\nbuilder.AddProject&lt;Projects.UI&gt;(\"ui\")\n    .WaitFor(api)\n    .WithReference(api);\n\nawait builder.Build().RunAsync();\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nYou also need to install a couple of nuget packages.&nbsp;<strong>Aspire.Hosting.SqlServer</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Aspire.Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer</strong>&nbsp;the second one is because my project is using Entity Framework. Lets look at what we have, we are defining a SQL Server called sql, with a data volume called sql-data, and a database called Project, which we can refer to as Context. We then configure API to reference the sql server we have just configured, and wait for sql server to be ready before starting the API. Next the Blazor project depends on the API and will wait for that to be ready before starting. Pretty powerful stuff.</p>\n<p>\\\nOK lets look at the API project, what do I need to configure in my connectionstrings? Not much, Aspire will fill all of this in for you.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">  \"ConnectionStrings\": {\n    \"Context\": \"\"\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nIn your API project, your Program.cs will need a nuget package&nbsp;<strong>Aspire.Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer</strong>&nbsp;and the following line, and no need for any pulling config and passing in connection strings.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"csharp language-csharp\">builder.AddSqlServerDbContext&lt;Context&gt;(\"Context\");\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nOne more clever thing we can do with Aspire is seed some data into my database before starting the project. Update the code that sets up your database in the AppHost project as follows.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"csharp language-csharp\">var sqldb = builder.AddSqlServer(\"sql\")\n    .WithBindMount(\"./sqlserverconfig\", \"/usr/config\")\n    .WithBindMount(\"../API/data/sqlserver\", \"/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d\")\n    .WithEntrypoint(\"/usr/config/entrypoint.sh\")\n    .WithDataVolume(\"sql-data\")\n    .AddDatabase(\"Context\", \"Project\")\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nAdd a sqlserverconfig folder inside your AppHost project and add the following two files. I have found entrypoint.sh being a bit picky with its line endings (windows vs linux)</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash language-bash\">#!/bin/bash\n\n# Adapted from: https://github.com/microsoft/mssql-docker/blob/80e2a51d0eb1693f2de014fb26d4a414f5a5add5/linux/preview/examples/mssql-customize/entrypoint.sh\n\n# Start the script to create the DB and user\n/usr/config/configure-db.sh &amp;\n\n# Start SQL Server\n/opt/mssql/bin/sqlservr\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"csharp language-csharp\">#!/bin/bash\n\n# set -x\n\n# Adapted from: https://github.com/microsoft/mssql-docker/blob/80e2a51d0eb1693f2de014fb26d4a414f5a5add5/linux/preview/examples/mssql-customize/configure-db.sh\n\n# Wait 60 seconds for SQL Server to start up by ensuring that\n# calling SQLCMD does not return an error code, which will ensure that sqlcmd is accessible\n# and that system and user databases return \"0\" which means all databases are in an \"online\" state\n# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-databases-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017\n\ndbstatus=1\nerrcode=1\nstart_time=$SECONDS\nend_by=$((start_time + 60))\n\necho \"Starting check for SQL Server start-up at $start_time, will end at $end_by\"\n\nwhile [[ $SECONDS -lt $end_by &amp;&amp; ( $errcode -ne 0 || ( -z \"$dbstatus\" || $dbstatus -ne 0 ) ) ]]; do\n    dbstatus=\"$(/opt/mssql-tools18/bin/sqlcmd -h -1 -t 1 -U sa -P \"$MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD\" -C -Q \"SET NOCOUNT ON; Select SUM(state) from sys.databases\")\"\n    errcode=$?\n    sleep 1\ndone\n\nelapsed_time=$((SECONDS - start_time))\necho \"Stopped checking for SQL Server start-up after $elapsed_time seconds (dbstatus=$dbstatus,errcode=$errcode,seconds=$SECONDS)\"\n\nif [[ $dbstatus -ne 0 ]] || [[ $errcode -ne 0 ]]; then\n    echo \"SQL Server took more than 60 seconds to start up or one or more databases are not in an ONLINE state\"\n    echo \"dbstatus = $dbstatus\"\n    echo \"errcode = $errcode\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n# Loop through the .sql files in the /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d and execute them with sqlcmd\nfor f in /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/*.sql\ndo\n    echo \"Processing $f file...\"\n    /opt/mssql-tools18/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P \"$MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD\" -C -d master -i \"$f\"\ndone\n</code></pre>\n<p>The second BindMount line mounts a folder inside your API project, so add a data folder with a subfolder called sqlserver. Inside that add a sql script called init.sql. Put all your CREATE DATABASE and CREATE TABLES sql commands inside this. And if everything works you will have a seeded DB ready to test your application with.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This is just a few things I have done with Aspire.

Although I’m a potential customer but still not paying for any of their plan, for many reasons.</p>\n<p>\\\nBeing a free account user, I’ve never done torrenting or any other heavy usage on their servers. It is not moral even though the provider allows me to.</p>\n<p>\\\nProbably because of my account was old enough so that my country selection feature wasn’t banned until latest update.</p>\n<p>\\\nThere are some concerns that preventing me from paying their services to regain that feature. It’s not about their product, but more about their business strategy.</p>\n<p>\\\nAlthough there are always some criticism and antagonism among the community.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://podcast.simplifiedprivacy.com/proton/index.html\">Protonmail is Propaganda</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtu.be/GKEEohgtxPk\">ProtonMail doesn’t encrypt all emails “by design”</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2021/09/protonmail-now-keeps-ip-logs.html\">ProtonMail Now Keeps IP Logs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtu.be/tum4FxVJVRg\">NEVER Use ProtonMail Without This NEW FEATURE! PRIVATE Email</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nBut my stand is more towards where <a href=\"https://www.youtu.be/9ZLMDMk5rzk\">All Things Secured</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtu.be/ZZphjOABE4Y\">Techlore</a> are. That is, as long as Proton is better than Google, issue with registration, warrant canary or false advertising are tolerable. However, now I’ll be putting a question mark on that though.</p>\n<p>\\\nProtonmail was like another Tutanota, and Proton VPN was like another IVPN/PIA. But, is it? still…by now?</p>\n<p>\\\nAs the company grows, their policy is getting loser and loser, and their suit is getting larger and larger. They starts to put more attention tweaking their terms of service rather than refining their product. They prefer expansion rather than perfection, and care more about market share rather than user experience.</p>\n<p>\\\nDoes this market strategy sound familiar? Yes, my concern is that Proton now looks too much like baby Google back in the days. Free users are going to be their products, and that is <a href=\"https://www.youtu.be/rimtaSgGz_4\">when enshittification starts</a>.</p>\n<p>\\\nI strongly agree with Cory Doctorow and I believe that Proton is indeed going on the same track right now. Privacy is nothing more than another brand positioning strategy because that was a good niche market to start their business.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn the economy of <a href=\"https://www.youtu.be/vluAOGJPPoM\">Chokepoint Capitalism</a>, Proton is not different than Google in its core. If one day Proton gets to the top of market dominance, becoming yet another big tech company, what would end up happening?</p>\n<p>\\\nMy answer to this concern is to against market expansion by advocating open-source community back to free/GNU realm. In the privacy and security world, open-source isn’t enough and could be abused.</p>\n<p>\\\nOrganization should stay focus in-depth and refine their product or service for optimization, not the other way around. They should not conquer new markets, and expand feature or create new product quicker than demands.</p>\n<p>\\\nAnother bad example is what Proton and SimpleLogin did. Bundle everything together to become a one-stop solution is against the principle of decentralization which is a no-no for privacy.</p>\n<p>\\\nBack to reality, how do I personally deal with the enshittification of Proton VPN which gets in my way unexpectedly?</p>\n<p>\\\nThere is a simple workaround for Proton VPN’s region lock and it’s officially supported.</p>\n<p>\\\nPer their current statement, free plan gets “more” countries/servers in recent updates, but users just can’t manual select them due to the newly updated restriction in their app.</p>\n<p>\\\nSo the solution is to ditch their official client and use a 3rd party open-source alternative.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis is pretty much the same way as <a href=\"https://protonvpn.com/support/installing-protonvpn-on-a-router/\">using Proton VPN on a router</a>.</p>\n<p>\\\nThere are official OpenVPN guides on the <a href=\"https://account.protonvpn.com/downloads\">account’s downloads page</a> for every single platform on how to manually install and connect your configuration files based on the server of your choice.</p>\n<p>\\\nCheck them out: <a href=\"https://protonvpn.com/support/android-vpn-setup/\">Android</a> <a href=\"https://protonvpn.com/support/ios-vpn-setup/\">iOS</a> <a href=\"https://protonvpn.com/support/openvpn-windows-setup/\">Windows</a> <a href=\"https://protonvpn.com/support/mac-vpn-setup/\">macOS</a> and <a href=\"https://protonvpn.com/support/linux-vpn-setup/\">GNU/Linux</a></p>\n<p>\\\nBut what I did is <a href=\"https://protonvpn.com/support/wireguard-configurations/\">WireGuard</a>. They have the guides as well for <a href=\"https://protonvpn.com/support/wireguard-manual-windows/\">Windows</a> <a href=\"https://protonvpn.com/support/wireguard-manual-macos/\">macOS</a> <a href=\"https://protonvpn.com/support/wireguard-linux\">Linux</a> <a href=\"https://protonvpn.com/support/wireguard-manual-android/\">Android</a> and <a href=\"https://protonvpn.com/support/wireguard-manual-ios/\">iOS</a>. There are many other unofficial guides on different router firmwares but I don’t need to go that far.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhat I liked about WireGuard over OpenVPN is that despite all the security advantages, it is convenient for mobile devices. The WireGuard client supports QR code scan from the Proton website’s Create button. This made the process much easier when I trying to add multiple servers.</p>\n<p>\\\nWireGuard mobile app works more reliable and efficient on my device than ProtonVPN app. The only potential drawback is I have to maintain my list of servers manually over time.</p>\n<p>\\\nHope this can help someone in the same situation.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Secret To AI Profitability Is Hiring a Lot More Doctorates","url":"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/12/10/103244/secret-to-ai-profitability-is-hiring-a-lot-more-doctorates?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1733824980,"author":"msmash","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"As tech giants struggle to profit from AI, a growing industry of specialized AI training firms is emerging by hiring doctors, radiologists and other experts to develop commercially viable applications.

Many of these apps compete with each other and have raised large amounts of money. Some have become a part of our daily lives, and we use them almost like everyday words. However, a serious issue remains: <strong>millions of people around the world, especially in developing countries, do not have access to basic banking services and are excluded from the global financial system.</strong></p>\n<p>\\\nDespite significant progress in recent years, financial exclusion remains a global challenge. A <a href=\"https://www.gpfi.org/sites/gpfi/files/GPFI_Paper_240704_P.pdf\">recent study</a> found that by the end of 2023, over 200 million migrants sent an estimated US$656 billion in remittances to at least 800 million people in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). </p>\n<p>\\\nAnd here’s another trivia-worthy fact: <strong><a href=\"https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/digital-remittance-market\">the digital remittance market</a></strong> was last valued at $19.8 billion in 2023 and is only projected to grow from here. The same study suggests a staggering compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.7% to reach $43.26 billion by 2028. However, many of these recipients lack access to formal financial services, limiting their ability to fully leverage these funds for economic advancement. To put this into simple terms, most of these recipients do not even have access to a bank account.</p>\n<p>\\\nCritics might argue that technology alone can't solve this problem. They’re right – in a way. But they're missing the point. </p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>See, Technology was never meant to solve the problem in its entirety. Its job is to catalyze this change. And we’ve seen this work in multiple cases. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\\\nTake, for instance, the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) proactive stance in promoting digitalization. They combined cutting-edge tech with forward-thinking policies, enabling fintech participation in remittance flows. This serves as a blueprint for how regulators can foster innovation with compliance.</p>\n<p>\\\nAnd the data backs it up. According to <strong><a href=\"https://thepaypers.com/payments-general/rbi-report-india-accounts-for-nearly-half-of-global-digital-payments--1269498#\">recent reports</a></strong>, India accounts for half of global payment volume with a staggering 50% CAGR from 2017-2024, involving 164 billion transactions worth 510 billion in 2023-24 alone. India has also taken a localized approach to this. They’ve managed to embed fintech into the India Stack, including biometric identification, the unified payments interface (UPI), mobile connectivity, digital lockers, and consent-based data sharing. And they’re not alone. China, too, is emerging as a major player with its Belt and Road Initiative. With apps like WeChat Pay and AliPay, China is expanding its digital payment ecosystem to those who are most in need of it.</p>\n<p>\\\nHowever, despite Technology’s potential impact on fostering financial inclusion, we still face regulatory hurdles. According to <strong><a href=\"https://www.gsma.com/sotir/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GSMA-SOTIR-2024_Report_v7-2.pdf\">GSMA's 2024 State of the Industry Report</a></strong> on Mobile Money, there are still regulatory barriers that limit the full potential of digital remittances in Africa, with several African countries maintaining restrictions on sending remittances to mobile money accounts. And then there’s high costs. Sub-Saharan Africa saw an average cost of 7.39% for a $200 transfer, significantly higher than <strong><a href=\"https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/rpw_main_report_and_annex_q124_final.pdf\">India’s 4.95% for the same period (Q3 2023)</a></strong> High costs are partly due to limited competition, regulatory barriers, and underdeveloped financial infrastructure in the continent. But there’s hope we can address this in the very near future and we’re witnessing some pretty transformative trends as we speak.</p>\n<p>\\\nMachine learning has come a long way and with public access to Gen-AI APIs, we can solve most rudimentary problems through software. Take, for instance, KYC and onboarding. Previously, these tasks required significant manpower and involved heavy paperwork. However, with the advent of KYC automation, the landscape has transformed.</p>\n<p>\\\nAI-driven biometric verification enhances security by ensuring the person onboarding is who they claim to be, streamlining the process. And for the cases where extra validation is needed, we can include a human-in-the-loop (HTIL) to make sure we’re not sacrificing compliance. AI has gotten to a place where most models can be trained to pretty much replicate most human actions - look for patterns, and anomalies and flag respective accounts where data is inconclusive. This should significantly bring down the cost of adoption and foster a competitive environment.</p>\n<p>\\\nWith the advent of open banking, and over <strong><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1389414/number-of-open-banking-api-calls-worldwide/\">100 billion APIs</a></strong> accessed globally, we’re transforming how financial services are delivered, particularly to underserved communities. Moreover, digital lending apps like Tala provide micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) with instant credit facilities without the need for collateral.</p>\n<p>\\\nHowever, there’s more work to be done. Concerted efforts are needed to fully leverage the potential of mobile money and digital remittances. We need to work towards a more unified regulatory environment to facilitate cross-border and interoperable instant payment systems. This will require support from both the public and private sectors. Enhancing digital infrastructure, including mobile networks and internet connectivity, is crucial for progress. It is essential for governments and regulators to facilitate the development and scaling of new technologies. This can be achieved through the establishment of innovation hubs, and public access to funding.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn conclusion, achieving financial inclusion presents both a challenge and a chance. It urges regulators, innovators, and the global community to work together, making certain that technology is utilized not only for efficiency but also for fairness.</p>\n<p>\\n </p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"NVIDIA Releases EGL-Wayland 1.1.17","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/NVIDIA-EGL-Wayland-1.1.17","date":1733827983,"author":"Michael Larabel","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"NVIDIA published EGL-Wayland 1.1.17 on Monday as the newest update to this Wayland EGL external platform library to provide client-side Wayland support to EGL atop the EGLDevice and EGLStream extensions...","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Servo Browser Engine Landed More Performance Optimizations In November","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Servo-November-2024","date":1733828251,"author":"Michael Larabel","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"The Servo browser engine project is out with their latest monthly status update to outline improvements made to this Rust-based open-source engine...","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Aqemia raises $38M to find new drugs by meshing theoretical physics with GenAI","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/10/aqemia-raises-38m-to-find-new-drugs-by-meshing-theoretical-physics-with-genai/","date":1733829228,"author":"Paul Sawers","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>Aqemia, a French startup that&#8217;s meshing &#8220;quantum-inspired physics&#8221; with machine learning to find new drugs, has raised $38 million in a fresh round of funding led by San Francisco-based VC firm Cathay Innovation.

From a report: Yau Shing-Tung retired from Harvard University in 2022 to teach at Tsinghua University and help China become a maths powerhouse.\nHe said many ethnic Chinese students had been driven away from the US by discrimination from the government, including accusations of misusing American research funds for China's benefit. \n\n\"Chinese scientists have no choice but to leave the US because they work best under a supportive research environment,\" he said. \"This exodus is unfortunate for the US as it could diminish its research capabilities. For China, the return of these scientists means it is gaining top talent, but it also results in weakened ties with the US and a loss of first-hand knowledge of advanced technologies.\" \n\nAn increasing number of leading scientists are leaving the West for Chinese institutions. Yau's maths centre at Tsinghua in Beijing is one example where top foreign mathematicians have been recruited.\nIn a survey of 1,300 US-based scientists of Chinese descent conducted between late 2021 and early 2022, 72 per cent of respondents said they did not feel safe as academic researchers. And 61 per cent said they had thought about leaving the United States for either Asian or non-Asian countries.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Chinese+Scientists+Have+No+Choice+But+To+Leave+US%2C+Top+Mathematician+Says%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F10%2F1339251%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F10%2F1339251%2Fchinese-scientists-have-no-choice-but-to-leave-us-top-mathematician-says%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/10/1339251/chinese-scientists-have-no-choice-but-to-leave-us-top-mathematician-says?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23547219&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"TeamViewer buys 1E, which detects PC software problems, for $720M","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/10/1e-which-detects-pc-software-problems-acquired-by-germanys-teamviewer-for-720m/","date":1733838583,"author":"Mike Butcher","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>U.K.-based 1E, which detects software problems on desktop PCs remotely, has been acquired by Germany-based remote-working company TeamViewer for $720 million.

From a report: Launched in August, the new design will eliminate the more than 125 million liters of water each data center typically uses per year, the company said in a statement. The new system use a \"closed loop\" to recycle water; liquid is added during construction and continually circulated -- obviating the need for fresh supplies. Data centers will still require fresh water for worker facilities like bathrooms and kitchens. \n\nMicrosoft spent more than $50 billion on capital expenditures in the fiscal year ended June 30, the vast majority related to data center construction fueled by demand for artificial intelligence services. It plans to top that figure in the current year, requiring rapidly rising amounts of energy to run the networks and water to cool equipment. Many of latest facilities are going up in hot, dry areas like Arizona and Texas, making it even more critical to find ways to conserve water. Microsoft's existing data centers will continue to use a mix of older technologies, but new projects in Phoenix and Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, will begin using the zero-water designs in 2026.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Microsoft+Unveils+Zero-Water+Data+Centers+To+Reduce+AI+Climate+Impact%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F10%2F1351222%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F10%2F1351222%2Fmicrosoft-unveils-zero-water-data-centers-to-reduce-ai-climate-impact%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/12/10/1351222/microsoft-unveils-zero-water-data-centers-to-reduce-ai-climate-impact?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23547223&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Duolingo teams up with Netflix to help ‘Squid Game’ fans learn Korean","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/10/duolingo-teams-up-with-netflix-to-help-squid-game-fans-learn-korean/","date":1733842800,"author":"Lauren Forristal","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<p>Attention, players.
