      "content": "The Guardian reports:\n People working in the music sector will lose almost a quarter of their income to artificial intelligence within the next four years, according to the first global economic study examining the impact of the emerging technology on human creativity. Those working in the audiovisual sector will also see their income shrink by more than 20% as the market for generative AI grows from &euro;3bn (A$4.9bn) annually to a predicted &euro;64bn by 2028. \n\nThe findings were released in Paris on Wednesday by the International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers (CISAC), representing more than 5 million creators worldwide. The report concluded that while the AI boom will substantially enrich giant tech companies, creators' rights and income streams will be drastically reduced unless policymakers step in... \n\nThe study concluded that under current regulatory frameworks in most countries, creators stand to lose on two fronts. Unauthorised use of their works by generative AI models will eat into remuneration earned through copyright, while at the same time work opportunities will shrink as AI-generated outputs become more competitive against human-made works. The report predicted that by 2028, exponential growth in generative AI music would account for about 20% of traditional music streaming platforms' revenues, and about 60% of music libraries' revenues. \nThe report warned of revenue \"derived directly from the unlicensed reproduction of creators' works, representing a transfer of economic value from creators to AI companies,\" according to the article. \n\nOn a hopeful note, it adds that the CISAC's president also applauded Australia and New Zealand for their thoughtful response to the issue. \"By setting a gold standard in AI policy, one that protects creators' rights while fostering responsible and innovative technological development, Australia and New Zealand can ensure that AI serves as a tool to enhance human creativity rather than replace it.\" \n\nThanks to Slashdodt reader Bruce66423 for sharing the news.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Music+Sector+Workers+Will+Lose+Nearly+a+Quarter+of+Their+Income+to+AI+in+4+Years%2C+Study+Suggests%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fentertainment.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F038224%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fentertainment.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F038224%2Fmusic-sector-workers-will-lose-nearly-a-quarter-of-their-income-to-ai-in-4-years-study-suggests%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/24/12/05/038224/music-sector-workers-will-lose-nearly-a-quarter-of-their-income-to-ai-in-4-years-study-suggests?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23542027&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

      "content": "\"Are Primordial Black Holes real...?\" asks Universe Today. \"If they do exist, a \"new paper suggests they may be hiding in places so unlikely that nobody ever thought to look there...\" &mdash; in planets, in asteroids, and here on earth.\n\nPhysicists hypothesize that Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) formed in the early Universe from extremely dense pockets of sub-atomic matter that collapsed directly into black holes. They could form part or all of what we call dark matter. However, they remain hypothetical because none have been observed... The authors claim that evidence for PBHs could be found in objects as large as hollowed out planetoids or asteroids and objects as small as rocks here on Earth. \"Small primordial black holes could be captured by rocky planets or asteroids, consume their liquid cores from inside and leave hollow structures,\" the authors write. \"Alternatively, a fast black hole can leave a narrow tunnel in a solid object while passing through it.\" \n\n\"We could look for such micro-tunnels here on Earth in very old rocks,\" the authors claim, explaining that the search wouldn't involve specialized, expensive equipment... \"The chances of finding these signatures are small, but searching for them would not require much resources and the potential payoff, the first evidence of a primordial black hole, would be immense,\" said Dejan Stojkovic [the paper's co-author from the State University of New York]. \"We have to think outside of the box because what has been done to find primordial black holes previously hasn't worked....\" Cosmology is kind of at a standstill while we wrestle with the idea of dark matter. Could PBHs be dark matter? Could they behave like the authors suggest, and be detected in this manner? \n\n\"The smartest people on the planet have been working on these problems for 80 years and have not solved them yet,\" Stojkovic said. \"We don't need a straightforward extension of the existing models. We probably need a completely new framework altogether.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Could+Evidence+of+Primordial+Black+Holes+Be+Hiding+in+Plain+Sight%3F%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F04%2F2223255%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F04%2F2223255%2Fcould-evidence-of-primordial-black-holes-be-hiding-in-plain-sight%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://science.slashdot.org/story/24/12/04/2223255/could-evidence-of-primordial-black-holes-be-hiding-in-plain-sight?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23541799&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

As part of the expansion, Nvidia, which supplies the GPUs, and Dell and Super Micro, which have assembled the server racks for the computer, will establish operations in Memphis, the chamber said in a statement. \n\nThe Greater Memphis chamber (an economic development organization) called it \"the largest capital investment in the region's history,\" even saying that xAI \"is setting the stage for Memphis to become the global epicenter of artificial intelligence.\" (\"To facilitate this massive undertaking, the Greater Memphis Chamber established an xAI Special Operations Team... This team provides round-the-clock concierge service to the company.\") \n\nReuters calls the supercomputer \"a critical component of advancing Musk's AI efforts, as the billionaire has deepened his rivalry against OpenAI...\" And the Greater Memphis chamber describes the expansion by Nvidia/Dell/Super Micro as \"further solidifying the city's position as the 'Digital Delta'...

      "content": "The Carnegie Endowment for Peace, a nonpartisan international affairs think tank, points out that when subsea internet cables were cut in November, Europe was more prepared:\n\n\nWhere in the past there were no contingency plans for sabotage, there are now more maritime patrols, an attempt to forge deeper intelligence connections, and the beginnings of a new relationship with the private sector... \n\n\nEven before the October 2023 incident, NATO, the EU, and certain European governments began to increase their efforts to boost subsea cable resilience and security. In February 2023, NATO stood up a new Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to convene stakeholders and enhance coordination between the public and private sectors. In July 2023, NATO allies at the Vilnius Summit established a Maritime Center for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure as part of the alliance's Maritime Command in Northwood, UK. In October 2023, after the first incident, NATO defense ministers endorsed a new Digital Ocean Vision, an initiative aimed at improving undersea surveillance. And in February 2024, the European Commission released its first \"Recommendation on Secure and Resilient Submarine Cable Infrastructures,\" encouraging member states to conduct regular stress tests, improve information sharing amongst themselves, and improve cable maintenance and repair capabilities. \n\n\nThe article points out that the Chinese ship suspected in the 2023 cable cutting \"ignored requests from Finnish and Estonian authorities to halt\" and returned to China. But the Chinese ship suspected in November's cable-cutting \"remains in international waters in the Kattegat, with naval and coast guard vessels from Denmark, Germany, and Sweden circling close by.\" Yet \"Under international maritime law, these countries' authorities are not allowed to board...\"\n\n Current provisions of international law are neither formulated to adequately protect subsea data cables from sabotage nor hold perpetrators accountable. This reality should lead the EU, as a body inherently focused on the resilience of international legal regimes, to push for updates that are better suited for the current geopolitical reality... Lawmakers should also explore ways to increase penalties for subsea cable damage, in part to deter acts of sabotage in the first place.... \nA forthcoming Carnegie Endowment report will detail more in-depth recommendations on how Europe can both protect itself against future subsea cable damage and help expand trusted networks around the world. \n\nThe article also notes that \"Of the hundreds of disruptions to cables that occur each year, the vast majority are caused by accidental human activity, like fishing, or natural events, like earthquakes.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Is+Europe+Better+Prepared+to+Protect+Undersea+Internet+Cables%3F%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F0521225%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F0521225%2Fis-europe-better-prepared-to-protect-undersea-internet-cables%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/12/05/0521225/is-europe-better-prepared-to-protect-undersea-internet-cables?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23542101&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

On Tuesday, the mobile device security firm iVerify is <a href=\"http://iverify.io/blog/iverify-mobile-threat-investigation-uncovers-new-pegasus-samples\">publishing findings</a> from a spyware detection feature it launched in May. Of 2,500 device scans that the company's customers elected to submit for inspection, seven revealed infections by the notorious NSO Group malware known as Pegasus.</p>\n<p>The company’s Mobile Threat Hunting feature uses a combination of malware signature-based detection, heuristics, and machine learning to look for anomalies in iOS and Android device activity or telltale signs of spyware infection. For paying iVerify customers, the tool regularly checks devices for potential compromise. But the company also offers a free version of the feature for anyone who downloads the iVerify Basics app for $1. These users can walk through steps to generate and send a special diagnostic utility file to iVerify and receive analysis within hours. Free users can use the tool once a month. iVerify's infrastructure is built to be privacy-preserving, but to run the Mobile Threat Hunting feature, users must enter an email address so the company has a way to contact them if a scan turns up spyware—as it did in the seven recent Pegasus discoveries.</p>\n<p>“The really fascinating thing is that the people who were targeted were not just journalists and activists, but business leaders, people running commercial enterprises, people in government positions,” says Rocky Cole, chief operating officer of iVerify and a former US National Security Agency analyst. “It looks a lot more like the targeting profile of your average piece of malware or your average APT group than it does the narrative that’s been out there that mercenary spyware is being abused to target activists. It is doing that, absolutely, but this cross section of society was surprising to find.”</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/12/1-phone-scanner-finds-seven-pegasus-spyware-infections/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/12/1-phone-scanner-finds-seven-pegasus-spyware-infections/#comments\">Comments</a></p>\n\n            ",

It's now worth $800 million... and James Howell wants it back. \n\nThe Guardian reports that his \"bid to become extremely rich reached a judge on Tuesday with a team of lawyers arguing that it was still possible to launch a hunt for his missing hard drive containing the bitcoin.\"\n\nThey claimed that rather than searching for a \"needle in a haystack\", the position of the bitcoin hoard had been narrowed down to a small area and there was a \"finely tuned\" plan to retrieve it... [Howells] has been asking Newport city council for help in getting the hard drive back, and even said he would share the money with the authority, to no avail... James Goudie KC, representing the council, said Howells had no legal claim to the hard drive. He said: \"Anything that goes into the landfill goes into the council's ownership.\" \n\nGoudie said Howells' offer to share some of the bitcoin with Newport council amounted to a bribe. He said: \"He is trying to buy something the council is not in a position to sell....\" Before the hearing, a spokesperson for Newport council said: \"The council has told Mr Howells multiple times that excavation is not possible under our environmental permit and that work of that nature would have a huge negative environmental impact on the surrounding area. \"Responding to Mr Howells' baseless claims are costing the council and Newport taxpayers time and money which could be better spent on delivering services.\"\n \n\nHowells was 28 when he lost the hard drive, and has said he may as well keep trying to recover it &mdash; because he'll always know that it's out there. Howells' legal teams are \"working pro bono,\" the article notes, \"on the basis that they get a share of the bitcoin profits if successful...\" And TechSpot points out that \"There's also the question of whether the data on the drive would still be accessible after more than a decade of sitting under a pile of rotting garbage. \n\n\"Howells has a team of data recovery engineers who are also working pro bono...\" \n\nThanks to Slashdot reader jjslash for sharing the news.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Hard+Drive+Tossed+in+Landfill+With+Bitcoin+Now+Worth+%24800+Million.+Lawsuits+Continue%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F1756216%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F1756216%2Fhard-drive-tossed-in-landfill-with-bitcoin-now-worth-800-million-lawsuits-continue%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/05/1756216/hard-drive-tossed-in-landfill-with-bitcoin-now-worth-800-million-lawsuits-continue?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23542665&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

Supply chain security firm Socket reports that Solana's Web3.js library was hijacked to push out two malicious versions to steal private and secret cryptography keys to secure wallets and sign transactions... Solana confirmed the breach, stating that one of their publish-access accounts was compromised, allowing the attackers to publish two malicious versions of the library... Solana is warning developers who suspect they were compromised to immediately upgrade to the latest v1.95.8 release and to rotate any keys, including multisigs, program authorities, and server keypairs... \n\nOnce the threat actors gain access to these keys, they can load them into their own wallets and remotely drain all stored cryptocurrency and NFTs... Socket says the attack has been traced to the FnvLGtucz4E1ppJHRTev6Qv4X7g8Pw6WPStHCcbAKbfx Solana address, which currently contains 674.86 Solana and varying amounts of the Irish Pepe , Star Atlas, Jupiter, USD Coin, Santa Hat, Pepe on Fire, Bonk, catwifhat, and Genopets Ki tokens. Solscan shows that the estimated value of the stolen cryptocurrency is $184,000 at the time of this writing. \n\nFor anyone whose wallets were compromised in this supply chain attack, you should immediately transfer any remaining funds to a new wallet and discontinue the use of the old one as the private keys are now compromised.\n \n Ars Technica adds that \"In social media posts, one person claimed to have lost $20,000 in the hack.\" \nThe compromised library \"receives more than ~350,000 weekly downloads on npm,\" Socket posted.

The industry continually seeks cutting-edge solutions to create immersive and unforgettable experiences and  <strong><a href=\"https://www.elation.global/\">Elation</a></strong> just shared two launches before the show floor opened—the <strong><a href=\"https://www.elation.global/\">PARAGON Series and the REBEL Profile</a></strong>™. But this isn’t just about new products; it’s about rethinking what lighting technology can do, blending innovation, creativity, and practicality to set new standards for the future.</p>\n<p>\\\nFor decades, the evolution of lighting has mirrored the progress of technology itself, transforming not only what is possible on stage but also behind the scenes. Elation’s announcements at LDI 2024 exemplify this intersection, with products that cater to the modern challenges of entertainment professionals while pushing the boundaries of creative expression.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe PARAGON Series, featuring Elation’s proprietary TruTone™ technology, represents a leap forward in adaptability and precision. TruTone’s ability to seamlessly adjust CRI from 70 to 93 allows for unparalleled control over color fidelity without altering color temperature. For lighting designers, this means skin tones, costumes, and scenery can be transformed with vibrant depth and accuracy, empowering them to create more visually dynamic environments with fewer fixtures.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The PARAGON Series represents far more than a mere incremental advancement in design technology—it represents a leap forward in intelligent, precision lighting for the entertainment industry, and has been designed to satisfy the highest creative standards,” said Nick Saiki, Product Application and Customer Experience Specialist, Elation. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\\\n“With TruTone technology, designers are no longer constrained by compromises between artistic vision and practical limitations, while its IP54 weatherproof rating means its wealth of design options can also be used to enhance temporary outdoor events, elevating its versatility for multi-event use.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/nyJ3v3rRv5NGM0ueVYbwsOuSUNr1-2024-12-05T21:02:11.123Z-pslo9zkglfawpvzy5ka6fy9k\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nOn the other hand, the REBEL Profile™ is Elation’s answer to the growing demand for compact, rugged fixtures that deliver top-tier performance. Its 500W LED engine offers intense beams and sharp projections, while an IP65 rating ensures durability in both indoor and outdoor environments. This combination of versatility and resilience makes the REBEL Profile an ideal solution for the fast-paced demands of modern productions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/nyJ3v3rRv5NGM0ueVYbwsOuSUNr1-nd136be.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"whylightinginnovationmatters\">Why Lighting Innovation Matters</h3>\n<p>Lighting isn’t just a functional element—it’s an integral part of storytelling. Whether in a concert, theatrical production, or live event, lighting directs focus, evokes emotion and creates atmosphere. Yet, the tools lighting professionals rely on often lag behind the creative aspirations of their users. Elation’s offerings aim to bridge that gap by providing:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhanced Efficiency: The multi-role functionality of the PARAGON Series reduces the number of fixtures needed, streamlining setups and cutting costs.</li>\n<li>Sustainability: Energy-efficient engines in both product lines address growing demands for greener solutions in live entertainment.</li>\n<li>Future-Proof Design: Features like TruTone and high-output LED engines ensure these fixtures remain relevant as industry needs evolve.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"lookingbacktolookforwardtheevolutionofstagelighting\">Looking Back to Look Forward: The Evolution of Stage Lighting</h3>\n<p>At LDI 2024, Elation is also debuting <em><strong><a href=\"https://www.elation.global/futureoflighting\">The Evolution of Stage Lighting</a></strong></em> <strong><a href=\"https://www.elation.global/futureoflighting\">infographic</a></strong>, a visual journey through the milestones that have shaped the industry. From the days of incandescent lamps to the rise of LED technology, this retrospective highlights how far lighting has come—and how innovations like PARAGON and REBEL are charting the course for the future. By highlighting the history and future of stage lighting, Elation is positioning itself not just as a product provider, but as a thought leader driving the industry forward.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/nyJ3v3rRv5NGM0ueVYbwsOuSUNr1-c8036ud.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThis year, the company has promoted it’s booth heavily which is designed as a retro-futuristic spaceport lounge, serves as a metaphor for the company’s vision. It’s a space where past and future collide, inviting attendees to explore the possibilities of what’s next. With live product demonstrations, an hourly light show, and immersive displays, the booth embodies the campaign theme, “Experience Tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The goal isn’t to just showcase products at LDI, but to guide visitors through a journey into lighting’s next frontier,” said Saiki. “We’re inviting lighting professionals to ‘Experience Tomorrow’ in an immersive spaceport-themed setting that highlights our visionary lighting solutions. We want professionals to walk away inspired by what’s possible, armed with the tools to make the extraordinary happen.”&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"lightingthepathforward\">Lighting the Path Forward</h3>\n<p>Elation’s offerings at LDI 2024 are more than just new fixtures—they are a bold statement about the direction of entertainment technology. By addressing real-world challenges with solutions that don’t compromise creativity, the company is setting a new benchmark for the industry.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe  future of lighting isn’t just about brighter beams or sharper projections—it’s about empowering designers to tell better stories, more efficiently, and with greater impact.</p>\n<p>\\n  \\n </p>",

      "content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">For my money, there isn't a better horror monster than The Thing's shape-shifting alien organism. Even 42 years later, Rob Bottin's practical effects are still incredible, capturing each freakish amalgamation of tentacles, sharp teeth, sinew, and traces of malformed humanity with ghastly clarity. I've seen The Thing dozens of times, yet seeing Norris' decapitated head contort and grow arthropod-esque legs will never fail to twist my stomach in knots. These are the everlasting images of The Thing, but it's the alien's ability to perfectly imitate anyone that genuinely terrifies, permeating each scene with an unnerving sense of dread and paranoia that affects both its characters and the audience watching. Who do you trust when anyone could be a clandestine threat?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Back in 2002, developer Computer Artworks attempted to translate this feeling into an officially licensed video game for The Thing. The now-shuttered studio came close to succeeding, too, creating a third-person horror-action game with a unique squad system that ensured you could never entirely trust the person fighting by your side. It's become somewhat of a cult classic since then, leading to this remaster from Nightdive Studios--a developer known for faithfully restoring myriad games, including Shadow Man and Star Wars: Dark Forces. The Thing: Remastered is a similarly authentic experience, albeit with a number of key improvements to the game's visuals, controls, and some quality-of-life mechanics. Beyond this, it's much the same game as it was in 2002, for both the good and the bad.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4410531-thethingremastered-augustscreenshot%282%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4410531\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4410531-thethingremastered-augustscreenshot%282%29.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4410531-thethingremastered-augustscreenshot%282%29.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4410531-thethingremastered-augustscreenshot%282%29.jpg 3840w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4410531-thethingremastered-augustscreenshot%282%29.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/43/434805/4410531-thethingremastered-augustscreenshot%282%29.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">The game's setup is one of its better aspects, acting as a direct sequel to John Carpenter's iconic 1982 film. You play as the bland, one-dimensional Captain Blake, leader of a U.S. Special Forces rescue team sent to investigate Outpost 31 in the isolating tundra of Antarctica. Of course, we know what transpired when MacReady and the rest of this research facility encountered the shape-shifting alien life-form, and it doesn't take long before Blake is fighting off all manner of horrific entities. He's rather nonchalant about the whole thing, though, anchoring a relatively thin story that feels distinctly 2002 in all the worst ways. While it begins as a more action-oriented facsimile of the film it's ostensibly a sequel to, the narrative quickly delves into predictable territory with the military experimenting on the Thing to use the alien for its own gain. It's all very stereotypical, with melodramatic voice acting and--aside from a fun cameo from John Carpenter himself--an inherently disposable cast of characters.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-thing-remastered-review-cold-fear/1900-6418323/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",

      "content": "<p>What is the one thing we all need to ask before we leave the house each morning?</p>\n<p>\\\n“What’s the weather going to be like today?”</p>\n<p>\\\nLuckily, we live in the transformational age of advanced and ever-evolving technology, and we now have the gift of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML).</p>\n<p>\\\nBy looking at years of weather data and pairing it with known weather patterns and outside factors, computers can now predict the weather like never before.</p>\n<p>\\\nFor instance, during the Paris Olympics this year, AI tools were used to provide a daily forecast of weather conditions.</p>\n<p>\\\nRecent advances in ML-based weather prediction (MLWP) have produced ML-based models with <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08252-9\">less forecast error</a> than simpler past models.</p>\n<p>\\\nAs <a href=\"https://eos.org/editor-highlights/machine-learning-masters-weather-prediction\">noted</a> by the science news magazine <em>EOS</em>, “It took fifty years to build and incrementally improve the sophisticated computer models needed to produce such accurate forecasts. It has taken ML approaches just a couple of years to match, and in some cases surpass, the skill of these traditional models.”</p>\n<p>\\\nNow, Google DeepMind scientists have developed a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/07/22/google-ai-weather-climate-forecast-model\">weather model</a> that largely beats the world’s most accurate modeling system. </p>\n<p>\\\nResearchers believe the model may be able to accurately predict unprecedented events that climate change accentuates.</p>\n<p>\\\nAccording to a report last month <a href=\"https://iccwbo.org/news-publications/policies-reports/new-report-extreme-weather-events-cost-economy-2-trillion-over-the-last-decade/\">commissioned by the International Chamber of Commerce</a>, “climate-related extreme weather events have cost the global economy more than $2 trillion over the past decade.”</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://www.maginative.com/article/gencast-a-new-weather-ai-from-google-deepmind-outperforms-leading-weather-forecasting-systems/\">According to Maginative</a>, “Google DeepMind’s new high-resolution AI model, GenCast, delivers faster, more accurate weather predictions than traditional methods. AI will fundamentally change how we plan for everyday weather and extreme events.”</p>\n<p>\\\nPart of the reason why this is such a significant development is because GenCast offers weather forecasts that are not only more reliable but also faster. Unlike traditional methods that rely on supercomputers and take hours, GenCast runs on a single TPU chip in just eight minutes, predicting a wide range of possible outcomes rather than a single scenario, as current weather prediction models do.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn contrast to traditional models, which make forecasts by solving physics equations, GenCast learns directly from historical weather data.</p>\n<p>\\\nJacob Mallinder, in CEO Today,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ceotodaymagazine.com/2024/12/9-must-know-ai-weather-forecasting-innovations/\">outlines some of the top AI innovations</a>&nbsp;that are&nbsp;making a difference in weather forecasting today.</p>\n<p>\\\nHe explains that aside from improved data gathering and predictive analytics, AI today allows for insight into climate change, agricultural optimization, improving efficiency in the energy sector, and enhancing aviation safety.</p>\n<p>\\\nMAELSTROM is another <a href=\"https://www.maelstrom-eurohpc.eu/\">large-scale R&D project</a>, aiming to fundamentally improve weather and climate prediction. It aims to combine the powers of high-performance computing (HPC) and ML to cope with the extreme complexity inherent in weather and climate forecasts.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn August, NVIDIA Research <a href=\"https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2024-08_kilometer-scale-convection-allowing-model-emulation-using-generative-diffusion\">announced a new generative AI model</a>, dubbed StormCast, for emulating high-fidelity atmospheric dynamics.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe model was built to provide reliable weather prediction at the mesoscale — a scale larger than storms but smaller than cyclones — which is critical for disaster planning and mitigation.</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://quantumcomputingreport.com/quantum-for-ai-weather-forecasting-are-we-there-yet/\">Quantum ML is another option</a>, but some experts believe it is not the optimal way to go as quantum computing is still in the early stages of development.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf it is the case that GenCast and other emerging technologies can predict serious weather events, it will introduce a monumental change. With such abilities, we can warn people ahead of time and prevent traffic accidents. Farmers can plan their farming and prevent crop loss. Energy companies will be able to run more effectively if they can understand sun and wind patterns in advance.</p>\n<p>\\\nAnd when we walk out the door, we won’t need to wonder what the weather will be like because we’ll already know.</p>",

Around half of Cuba's power generation facilities are offline for maintenance or broken down. All are decades old and producing well under capacity. \n\nAs a result, a majority of Cuba's residents suffer hours-long, rolling blackouts on a daily basis even when the grid is functional. Cuba's electrical grid has been on the brink of collapse for years, as fuel shortages, a string of natural disasters and an economic crisis have left the island's government unable to maintain the system's decrepit infrastructure. Dwindling oil imports from Venezuela, Russia and Mexico tipped the system into full crisis this year, leading to several nationwide blackouts that have sparked unrest and increasing anger among the population. The blackouts, together with food, medicine and water shortages, have vastly complicated life on the island and driven a record-breaking exodus of its residents since 2020. \n\nAuthorities informed Cuba's citizens that scheduled power outages will now resume, reports ABC News. \"Cuban authorities said they will continue their current practice of implementing daily, five-hour power outages by block or zone as they have been doing for the past few months.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Millions+of+Cubans+Had+Another+Power+Outage+Wednesday%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F220211%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F220211%2Fmillions-of-cubans-had-another-power-outage-wednesday%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/24/12/05/220211/millions-of-cubans-had-another-power-outage-wednesday?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23542899&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

It's the first time when MachineGames breaks loose from its linear shackles, presenting you with a massive play area to freely explore. I went from gawking at Michelangelo's masterpiece on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel to exploring the ancient ruins hidden deep beneath the holy city, spending more than three hours on this single level alone without coming close to completing every task in Indy's journal.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It's not quite what I expected from a studio known for its frenetic shooters, nor a game that's been described as a first-person action-adventure. For the most part, The Great Circle is a stealth game that resembles Dishonored more than any of MachineGames' previous output. Sure, you could skulk through the shadows in Wolfenstein, plunging knives into Nazi spines, but it was a shooter first and foremost. The Great Circle has moments of action, but its violence is sudden and tends to end quickly, indicative of Indiana Jones as a character; it wouldn't make sense if he were running and gunning like BJ Blazkowicz. It's a refreshing change of pace for the studio, and it's a rip-roaring good time, even if the inexperience of creating this sort of game sometimes shows.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In terms of story and tone, MachineGames definitely understood the assignment. The Great Circle's prologue is essentially a love letter to Raiders of the Lost Ark, immediately making it clear how much the studio both grasps and reveres the series and its globe-trotting protagonist. This feeling persists throughout the entire game, beginning with an opening level that takes place inside the fictional walls of Marshall College, where Indy teaches archeology. The Great Circle is set between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, weaving into the existing fabric of the series in a way that makes it feel like a natural extension of Indy's story. A few familiar faces return, and new characters seamlessly blend into its cinematic world, contributing to a compelling adventure that sees you travel the world, uncover ancient mysteries, and butt heads with the Axis powers.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",

      "content": "Today a group of German scientists presented data suggesting Earth is absorbing more sunlight than in the past, reports Ars Technica, \"largely due to reduced cloud cover.\"\n\n\nWe can measure both the amount of energy the Earth receives from the Sun and how much energy it radiates back into space.... The new paper finds that the energy imbalance set a new high in 2023, with a record amount of energy being absorbed by the ocean/atmosphere system. This wasn't accompanied by a drop in infrared emissions from the Earth, suggesting it wasn't due to greenhouse gases, which trap heat by absorbing this radiation. Instead, it seems to be due to decreased reflection of incoming sunlight by the Earth.... \n\nUsing two different data sets, the teams identify the areas most effected by this, and they're not at the poles, indicating loss of snow and ice are unlikely to be the cause. Instead, the key contributor appears to be the loss of low-level clouds [particularly over the Atlantic ocean]... The drop in low-level clouds had been averaging about 1.3 percent per decade. 2023 saw a slightly larger drop occur in just one year.... \n\nSo, what could be causing the clouds to go away? The researchers list three potential factors. One is simply the variability of the climate system, meaning 2023 might have just been an extremely unusual year, and things will revert to trends in the ensuing years. The second is the impact of aerosols, which both we and natural processes emit in copious quantities. These can help seed clouds, so a reduction of aerosols (driven by things like pollution control measures) could potentially account for this effect. The most concerning potential explanation, however, is that there may be a feedback relationship between rising temperatures and low-level clouds. Meaning that, as the Earth warms, the clouds become sparse, enhancing the warming further. That would be bad news for our future climate, because it suggests that the lower range of warming estimates would have to be adjusted upward to account for it. \n\nIf the decline in reflectivity wasn't just caused by normal variability, the researchers warn, \"the 2023 extra heat may be here to stay...\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Earth+Began+Absorbing+More+Sunlight+in+2023%2C+Climate+Researchers+Find%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F2324206%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F2324206%2Fearth-began-absorbing-more-sunlight-in-2023-climate-researchers-find%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/05/2324206/earth-began-absorbing-more-sunlight-in-2023-climate-researchers-find?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23542979&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

OpenAI's updates also include safety enhancements, with the o1-preview scoring 84 on a rigorous safety test, compared to 22 for its predecessor... \n\nTo encourage the use of AI in societal-benefit fields, OpenAI has announced the ChatGPT Pro Grant Program. The initiative will initially award 10 grants to leading medical researchers, providing free access to ChatGPT Pro tools.\n \nIn a video Altman displays graphs showing o1 dramatically outperforms gpt4o on math questions, on competition coding at CodeForces, and on PhD-level science questions.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=OpenAI+Releases+'Smarter%2C+Faster'+ChatGPT+-+Plus+%24200-a-Month+Subscriptions+for+'Even-Smarter+Mode'%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F06%2F0121217%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F06%2F0121217%2Fopenai-releases-smarter-faster-chatgpt---plus-200-a-month-subscriptions-for-even-smarter-mode%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://slashdot.org/story/24/12/06/0121217/openai-releases-smarter-faster-chatgpt---plus-200-a-month-subscriptions-for-even-smarter-mode?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23543071&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

      "content": "\"Okay, we're doing this,\" begins a new announcement at The Verge:\n\nToday we're launching a Verge subscription that lets you get rid of a bunch of ads, gets you unlimited access to our top-notch reporting and analysis across the site and our killer premium newsletters, and generally lets you support independent tech journalism in a world of sponsored influencer content. It'll cost $7 / month or $50 / year &mdash; and for a limited time, if you sign up for the annual plan, we'll send you an absolutely stunning print edition of our CONTENT GOBLINS series, with very fun new photography and design... A surprising number of you have asked us to launch something like this, and we're happy to deliver. If you don't want to pay, rest assured that big chunks of The Verge will remain free &mdash; we're thinking about subscriptions a lot differently than everyone else... \n\nIf you're a Verge reader, you know we've been covering massive, fundamental changes to how the internet works for years now. Most major social media platforms are openly hostile to links, huge changes to search have led to the death of small websites, and everything is covered in a layer of AI slop and weird scams. The algorithmic media ecosystem is now openly hostile to the kind of rigorous, independent journalism we want to do. \n\nA few years ago, we decided the only real way to survive all this was to stand apart and bet on our own website so that we could remain independent of these platforms and their algorithms. We didn't want to write stories to chase Google Search trends or because we thought they'd do well on social media. And we definitely didn't want to compromise our famously strict ethics policy to accept brand endorsement deals from the companies we cover, which almost all of our competitors in the creator economy are forced to do in order to run sustainable businesses... \n\n[W]e intend to keep making this thing together for a long, long time. So many of you like The Verge that we've actually gotten a shocking number of notes from people asking how they can pay to support our work. It's no secret that lots of great websites and publications have gone under over the past few years as the open web falls apart, and it's clear that directly supporting the creators you love is a big part of how everyone gets to stay working on the modern internet. At the same time, we didn't want to simply paywall the entire site &mdash; it's a tragedy that traditional journalism is retreating behind paywalls while nonsense spreads across platforms for free. \n\nThe print premium for subscribers is described as a \"beautiful / deranged print product\" that's drawn from a series of articles \"about what Google had done to the web, capped off by a feature about search engine optimization titled 'The People Who Ruined the Internet.'\"\nBut it ships with a satirical cover that instead proclaims it as \"The Verge Guide to Search Engine Optimization\". A tongue-in-check announcement explains:\n\n[A] year has passed, and we've had a change of heart. Maybe search engine optimization is actually a good thing. Maybe appeasing the search algorithm is not only a sustainable strategy for building a loyal audience, but also a strategic way to plan and produce content. What are journalists, if not content creators? Anyway, SEO community, consider this our apology. And what better way to say \"our bad, your industry is not a cesspool of AI slop but a brilliant vision of what a useful internet could look like\" than collecting all the things we've learned in one handy print magazine? Which is why I'm proud to introduce The Verge Guide to Search Engine Optimization: All the Tips, Tricks, Hints, Schemes, and Techniques for Promoting High-Quality Content! \t \nWhoops &mdash; slip off the cover and the real title appears: \"CONTENT GOBLINS\" (written in green slime). Again, it's \"an anthology of stories about 'content' and the people who 'make' it.\"\n\nIn very Verge fashion, we are meeting the moment where the internet has been overrun by AI garbage by publishing a beautifully designed, limited edition print product. (Also, the last time we printed a magazine, it won a very prestigious design award.) Content Goblins collects some of our best stories over the past couple years, capturing the cynical push for the world's great art and journalism to be reduced into units that can be packaged, distributed, and consumed on the internet. Consider Content Goblins as our resistance to that movement. With terrific new art and photography, we're making the case that great reporting is vital and enduring &mdash; and worth paying for. \n\nThis gorgeous, grotesque magazine can be yours if you commit to an annual subscription to The Verge &mdash; while supplies last.\n<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=The+Verge+Explains+Why%2C+After+13+Years%2C+It's+Offering+a+'Subscription'+Option+for+Its+Supporters%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F04%2F1959245%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F04%2F1959245%2Fthe-verge-explains-why-after-13-years-its-offering-a-subscription-option-for-its-supporters%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/04/1959245/the-verge-explains-why-after-13-years-its-offering-a-subscription-option-for-its-supporters?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23541687&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

      "content": "The use of lead in gasoline \"might have harmed the mental health of a generation,\" reports USA Today.\n\n\nGen X bears an extra burden of conditions such as depression, anxiety, ADHD and neurotic behavior because of the leaded gasoline they were exposed to as children, according to a study published Wednesday in the peer-reviewed Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry. Leaded gas was banned in the United States in 1996, but the study said years of exposure during development made them particularly vulnerable. \n\nLead gas peaked from the mid-1960s through the mid-1970s, and children born during that era would later develop some of the highest rates of mental health symptoms, the study said. The study also linked leaded gas to \"disadvantageous\" traits, such as struggling to concentrate, stay on task or organizing thoughts. \"I tend to think of Generation X as 'generation lead,'\" said Aaron Reuben, a study co-author and assistant professor of clinical neuropsychology at the University of Virginia. \"We know they were exposed to it more and we're estimating they have gone on to have higher rates of internalizing conditions like anxiety, depression and symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder....\" \n\nResearchers linked the lead exposure to an estimated 151 million \"excess mental disorders\" in the United States over the 75-year period. The estimates should be \"considered a floor\" because it relies mainly on gas and not exposure from lead in paint and pipes, Reuben said... Those born between 1966 and 1986 generally had higher mental illness levels linked to lead exposure with the rates peaking for those born between 1966 and 1970, the study said. Those rates coincided with the peak use of lead in gas from the mid-1960s through the mid-1970s... The study said the peak lead use coincided with increased demand for psychiatric care and higher rates of juvenile delinquency.\n \n Today there's routine blood screenings for high levels of lead, study co-author Reuben says. But in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, \"folks were walking around with an average blood lead value that today would trigger clinical follow-up.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=75+Years+of+Lead+in+Gasoline+Caused+150+Million+Mental+Health+Disorders%2C+Study+Finds%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F2356209%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F2356209%2F75-years-of-lead-in-gasoline-caused-150-million-mental-health-disorders-study-finds%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/05/2356209/75-years-of-lead-in-gasoline-caused-150-million-mental-health-disorders-study-finds?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23543021&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",
