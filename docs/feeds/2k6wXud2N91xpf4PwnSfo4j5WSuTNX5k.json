      "content": "\"Are Primordial Black Holes real...?\" asks Universe Today. \"If they do exist, a \"new paper suggests they may be hiding in places so unlikely that nobody ever thought to look there...\" &mdash; in planets, in asteroids, and here on earth.\n\nPhysicists hypothesize that Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) formed in the early Universe from extremely dense pockets of sub-atomic matter that collapsed directly into black holes. They could form part or all of what we call dark matter. However, they remain hypothetical because none have been observed... The authors claim that evidence for PBHs could be found in objects as large as hollowed out planetoids or asteroids and objects as small as rocks here on Earth. \"Small primordial black holes could be captured by rocky planets or asteroids, consume their liquid cores from inside and leave hollow structures,\" the authors write. \"Alternatively, a fast black hole can leave a narrow tunnel in a solid object while passing through it.\" \n\n\"We could look for such micro-tunnels here on Earth in very old rocks,\" the authors claim, explaining that the search wouldn't involve specialized, expensive equipment... \"The chances of finding these signatures are small, but searching for them would not require much resources and the potential payoff, the first evidence of a primordial black hole, would be immense,\" said Dejan Stojkovic [the paper's co-author from the State University of New York]. \"We have to think outside of the box because what has been done to find primordial black holes previously hasn't worked....\" Cosmology is kind of at a standstill while we wrestle with the idea of dark matter. Could PBHs be dark matter? Could they behave like the authors suggest, and be detected in this manner? \n\n\"The smartest people on the planet have been working on these problems for 80 years and have not solved them yet,\" Stojkovic said. \"We don't need a straightforward extension of the existing models. We probably need a completely new framework altogether.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Could+Evidence+of+Primordial+Black+Holes+Be+Hiding+in+Plain+Sight%3F%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F04%2F2223255%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F04%2F2223255%2Fcould-evidence-of-primordial-black-holes-be-hiding-in-plain-sight%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://science.slashdot.org/story/24/12/04/2223255/could-evidence-of-primordial-black-holes-be-hiding-in-plain-sight?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23541799&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

As part of the expansion, Nvidia, which supplies the GPUs, and Dell and Super Micro, which have assembled the server racks for the computer, will establish operations in Memphis, the chamber said in a statement. \n\nThe Greater Memphis chamber (an economic development organization) called it \"the largest capital investment in the region's history,\" even saying that xAI \"is setting the stage for Memphis to become the global epicenter of artificial intelligence.\" (\"To facilitate this massive undertaking, the Greater Memphis Chamber established an xAI Special Operations Team... This team provides round-the-clock concierge service to the company.\") \n\nReuters calls the supercomputer \"a critical component of advancing Musk's AI efforts, as the billionaire has deepened his rivalry against OpenAI...\" And the Greater Memphis chamber describes the expansion by Nvidia/Dell/Super Micro as \"further solidifying the city's position as the 'Digital Delta'...

In February 2023, NATO stood up a new Critical Undersea Infrastructure Coordination Cell in Brussels to convene stakeholders and enhance coordination between the public and private sectors. In July 2023, NATO allies at the Vilnius Summit established a Maritime Center for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure as part of the alliance's Maritime Command in Northwood, UK. In October 2023, after the first incident, NATO defense ministers endorsed a new Digital Ocean Vision, an initiative aimed at improving undersea surveillance. And in February 2024, the European Commission released its first \"Recommendation on Secure and Resilient Submarine Cable Infrastructures,\" encouraging member states to conduct regular stress tests, improve information sharing amongst themselves, and improve cable maintenance and repair capabilities. \n\n\nThe article points out that the Chinese ship suspected in the 2023 cable cutting \"ignored requests from Finnish and Estonian authorities to halt\" and returned to China. But the Chinese ship suspected in November's cable-cutting \"remains in international waters in the Kattegat, with naval and coast guard vessels from Denmark, Germany, and Sweden circling close by.\" Yet \"Under international maritime law, these countries' authorities are not allowed to board...\"\n\n Current provisions of international law are neither formulated to adequately protect subsea data cables from sabotage nor hold perpetrators accountable. This reality should lead the EU, as a body inherently focused on the resilience of international legal regimes, to push for updates that are better suited for the current geopolitical reality... Lawmakers should also explore ways to increase penalties for subsea cable damage, in part to deter acts of sabotage in the first place.... \nA forthcoming Carnegie Endowment report will detail more in-depth recommendations on how Europe can both protect itself against future subsea cable damage and help expand trusted networks around the world. \n\nThe article also notes that \"Of the hundreds of disruptions to cables that occur each year, the vast majority are caused by accidental human activity, like fishing, or natural events, like earthquakes.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Is+Europe+Better+Prepared+to+Protect+Undersea+Internet+Cables%3F%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F0521225%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F0521225%2Fis-europe-better-prepared-to-protect-undersea-internet-cables%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/12/05/0521225/is-europe-better-prepared-to-protect-undersea-internet-cables?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23542101&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

At the same time, though, it has been difficult to check devices for infection, leading individuals to navigate an ad hoc array of academic institutions and NGOs that have been on the front lines of developing forensic techniques to detect mobile spyware. On Tuesday, the mobile device security firm iVerify is <a href=\"http://iverify.io/blog/iverify-mobile-threat-investigation-uncovers-new-pegasus-samples\">publishing findings</a> from a spyware detection feature it launched in May. Of 2,500 device scans that the company's customers elected to submit for inspection, seven revealed infections by the notorious NSO Group malware known as Pegasus.</p>\n<p>The company’s Mobile Threat Hunting feature uses a combination of malware signature-based detection, heuristics, and machine learning to look for anomalies in iOS and Android device activity or telltale signs of spyware infection. For paying iVerify customers, the tool regularly checks devices for potential compromise. But the company also offers a free version of the feature for anyone who downloads the iVerify Basics app for $1. These users can walk through steps to generate and send a special diagnostic utility file to iVerify and receive analysis within hours. Free users can use the tool once a month. iVerify's infrastructure is built to be privacy-preserving, but to run the Mobile Threat Hunting feature, users must enter an email address so the company has a way to contact them if a scan turns up spyware—as it did in the seven recent Pegasus discoveries.</p>\n<p>“The really fascinating thing is that the people who were targeted were not just journalists and activists, but business leaders, people running commercial enterprises, people in government positions,” says Rocky Cole, chief operating officer of iVerify and a former US National Security Agency analyst. “It looks a lot more like the targeting profile of your average piece of malware or your average APT group than it does the narrative that’s been out there that mercenary spyware is being abused to target activists. It is doing that, absolutely, but this cross section of society was surprising to find.”</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/12/1-phone-scanner-finds-seven-pegasus-spyware-infections/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/12/1-phone-scanner-finds-seven-pegasus-spyware-infections/#comments\">Comments</a></p>\n\n            ",

It's now worth $800 million... and James Howell wants it back. \n\nThe Guardian reports that his \"bid to become extremely rich reached a judge on Tuesday with a team of lawyers arguing that it was still possible to launch a hunt for his missing hard drive containing the bitcoin.\"\n\nThey claimed that rather than searching for a \"needle in a haystack\", the position of the bitcoin hoard had been narrowed down to a small area and there was a \"finely tuned\" plan to retrieve it... [Howells] has been asking Newport city council for help in getting the hard drive back, and even said he would share the money with the authority, to no avail... James Goudie KC, representing the council, said Howells had no legal claim to the hard drive. He said: \"Anything that goes into the landfill goes into the council's ownership.\" \n\nGoudie said Howells' offer to share some of the bitcoin with Newport council amounted to a bribe. He said: \"He is trying to buy something the council is not in a position to sell....\" Before the hearing, a spokesperson for Newport council said: \"The council has told Mr Howells multiple times that excavation is not possible under our environmental permit and that work of that nature would have a huge negative environmental impact on the surrounding area. \"Responding to Mr Howells' baseless claims are costing the council and Newport taxpayers time and money which could be better spent on delivering services.\"\n \n\nHowells was 28 when he lost the hard drive, and has said he may as well keep trying to recover it &mdash; because he'll always know that it's out there. Howells' legal teams are \"working pro bono,\" the article notes, \"on the basis that they get a share of the bitcoin profits if successful...\" And TechSpot points out that \"There's also the question of whether the data on the drive would still be accessible after more than a decade of sitting under a pile of rotting garbage. \n\n\"Howells has a team of data recovery engineers who are also working pro bono...\" \n\nThanks to Slashdot reader jjslash for sharing the news.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Hard+Drive+Tossed+in+Landfill+With+Bitcoin+Now+Worth+%24800+Million.+Lawsuits+Continue%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F1756216%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F1756216%2Fhard-drive-tossed-in-landfill-with-bitcoin-now-worth-800-million-lawsuits-continue%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/05/1756216/hard-drive-tossed-in-landfill-with-bitcoin-now-worth-800-million-lawsuits-continue?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23542665&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

Supply chain security firm Socket reports that Solana's Web3.js library was hijacked to push out two malicious versions to steal private and secret cryptography keys to secure wallets and sign transactions... Solana confirmed the breach, stating that one of their publish-access accounts was compromised, allowing the attackers to publish two malicious versions of the library... Solana is warning developers who suspect they were compromised to immediately upgrade to the latest v1.95.8 release and to rotate any keys, including multisigs, program authorities, and server keypairs... \n\nOnce the threat actors gain access to these keys, they can load them into their own wallets and remotely drain all stored cryptocurrency and NFTs... Socket says the attack has been traced to the FnvLGtucz4E1ppJHRTev6Qv4X7g8Pw6WPStHCcbAKbfx Solana address, which currently contains 674.86 Solana and varying amounts of the Irish Pepe , Star Atlas, Jupiter, USD Coin, Santa Hat, Pepe on Fire, Bonk, catwifhat, and Genopets Ki tokens.

      "content": "<p>The entertainment industry is descending upon Las Vegas this week and next for the annual LDI Show. The industry continually seeks cutting-edge solutions to create immersive and unforgettable experiences and  <strong><a href=\"https://www.elation.global/\">Elation</a></strong> just shared two launches before the show floor opened—the <strong><a href=\"https://www.elation.global/\">PARAGON Series and the REBEL Profile</a></strong>™. But this isn’t just about new products; it’s about rethinking what lighting technology can do, blending innovation, creativity, and practicality to set new standards for the future.</p>\n<p>\\\nFor decades, the evolution of lighting has mirrored the progress of technology itself, transforming not only what is possible on stage but also behind the scenes. Elation’s announcements at LDI 2024 exemplify this intersection, with products that cater to the modern challenges of entertainment professionals while pushing the boundaries of creative expression.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe PARAGON Series, featuring Elation’s proprietary TruTone™ technology, represents a leap forward in adaptability and precision. TruTone’s ability to seamlessly adjust CRI from 70 to 93 allows for unparalleled control over color fidelity without altering color temperature. For lighting designers, this means skin tones, costumes, and scenery can be transformed with vibrant depth and accuracy, empowering them to create more visually dynamic environments with fewer fixtures.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The PARAGON Series represents far more than a mere incremental advancement in design technology—it represents a leap forward in intelligent, precision lighting for the entertainment industry, and has been designed to satisfy the highest creative standards,” said Nick Saiki, Product Application and Customer Experience Specialist, Elation. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\\\n“With TruTone technology, designers are no longer constrained by compromises between artistic vision and practical limitations, while its IP54 weatherproof rating means its wealth of design options can also be used to enhance temporary outdoor events, elevating its versatility for multi-event use.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/nyJ3v3rRv5NGM0ueVYbwsOuSUNr1-2024-12-05T21:02:11.123Z-pslo9zkglfawpvzy5ka6fy9k\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nOn the other hand, the REBEL Profile™ is Elation’s answer to the growing demand for compact, rugged fixtures that deliver top-tier performance. Its 500W LED engine offers intense beams and sharp projections, while an IP65 rating ensures durability in both indoor and outdoor environments. This combination of versatility and resilience makes the REBEL Profile an ideal solution for the fast-paced demands of modern productions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/nyJ3v3rRv5NGM0ueVYbwsOuSUNr1-nd136be.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"whylightinginnovationmatters\">Why Lighting Innovation Matters</h3>\n<p>Lighting isn’t just a functional element—it’s an integral part of storytelling. Whether in a concert, theatrical production, or live event, lighting directs focus, evokes emotion and creates atmosphere. Yet, the tools lighting professionals rely on often lag behind the creative aspirations of their users. Elation’s offerings aim to bridge that gap by providing:</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhanced Efficiency: The multi-role functionality of the PARAGON Series reduces the number of fixtures needed, streamlining setups and cutting costs.</li>\n<li>Sustainability: Energy-efficient engines in both product lines address growing demands for greener solutions in live entertainment.</li>\n<li>Future-Proof Design: Features like TruTone and high-output LED engines ensure these fixtures remain relevant as industry needs evolve.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"lookingbacktolookforwardtheevolutionofstagelighting\">Looking Back to Look Forward: The Evolution of Stage Lighting</h3>\n<p>At LDI 2024, Elation is also debuting <em><strong><a href=\"https://www.elation.global/futureoflighting\">The Evolution of Stage Lighting</a></strong></em> <strong><a href=\"https://www.elation.global/futureoflighting\">infographic</a></strong>, a visual journey through the milestones that have shaped the industry. From the days of incandescent lamps to the rise of LED technology, this retrospective highlights how far lighting has come—and how innovations like PARAGON and REBEL are charting the course for the future. By highlighting the history and future of stage lighting, Elation is positioning itself not just as a product provider, but as a thought leader driving the industry forward.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/nyJ3v3rRv5NGM0ueVYbwsOuSUNr1-c8036ud.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThis year, the company has promoted it’s booth heavily which is designed as a retro-futuristic spaceport lounge, serves as a metaphor for the company’s vision. It’s a space where past and future collide, inviting attendees to explore the possibilities of what’s next. With live product demonstrations, an hourly light show, and immersive displays, the booth embodies the campaign theme, “Experience Tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The goal isn’t to just showcase products at LDI, but to guide visitors through a journey into lighting’s next frontier,” said Saiki. “We’re inviting lighting professionals to ‘Experience Tomorrow’ in an immersive spaceport-themed setting that highlights our visionary lighting solutions. We want professionals to walk away inspired by what’s possible, armed with the tools to make the extraordinary happen.”&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"lightingthepathforward\">Lighting the Path Forward</h3>\n<p>Elation’s offerings at LDI 2024 are more than just new fixtures—they are a bold statement about the direction of entertainment technology. By addressing real-world challenges with solutions that don’t compromise creativity, the company is setting a new benchmark for the industry.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe  future of lighting isn’t just about brighter beams or sharper projections—it’s about empowering designers to tell better stories, more efficiently, and with greater impact.</p>\n<p>\\n  \\n </p>",

Even 42 years later, Rob Bottin's practical effects are still incredible, capturing each freakish amalgamation of tentacles, sharp teeth, sinew, and traces of malformed humanity with ghastly clarity. I've seen The Thing dozens of times, yet seeing Norris' decapitated head contort and grow arthropod-esque legs will never fail to twist my stomach in knots. These are the everlasting images of The Thing, but it's the alien's ability to perfectly imitate anyone that genuinely terrifies, permeating each scene with an unnerving sense of dread and paranoia that affects both its characters and the audience watching. Who do you trust when anyone could be a clandestine threat?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Back in 2002, developer Computer Artworks attempted to translate this feeling into an officially licensed video game for The Thing. The now-shuttered studio came close to succeeding, too, creating a third-person horror-action game with a unique squad system that ensured you could never entirely trust the person fighting by your side. It's become somewhat of a cult classic since then, leading to this remaster from Nightdive Studios--a developer known for faithfully restoring myriad games, including Shadow Man and Star Wars: Dark Forces. The Thing: Remastered is a similarly authentic experience, albeit with a number of key improvements to the game's visuals, controls, and some quality-of-life mechanics. Beyond this, it's much the same game as it was in 2002, for both the good and the bad.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4410531-thethingremastered-augustscreenshot%282%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4410531\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4410531-thethingremastered-augustscreenshot%282%29.jpg\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4410531-thethingremastered-augustscreenshot%282%29.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4410531-thethingremastered-augustscreenshot%282%29.jpg 3840w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4410531-thethingremastered-augustscreenshot%282%29.jpg 1280w, https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/43/434805/4410531-thethingremastered-augustscreenshot%282%29.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" data-width=\"1280\"></a></figure><p dir=\"ltr\">The game's setup is one of its better aspects, acting as a direct sequel to John Carpenter's iconic 1982 film. You play as the bland, one-dimensional Captain Blake, leader of a U.S. Special Forces rescue team sent to investigate Outpost 31 in the isolating tundra of Antarctica. Of course, we know what transpired when MacReady and the rest of this research facility encountered the shape-shifting alien life-form, and it doesn't take long before Blake is fighting off all manner of horrific entities. He's rather nonchalant about the whole thing, though, anchoring a relatively thin story that feels distinctly 2002 in all the worst ways. While it begins as a more action-oriented facsimile of the film it's ostensibly a sequel to, the narrative quickly delves into predictable territory with the military experimenting on the Thing to use the alien for its own gain. It's all very stereotypical, with melodramatic voice acting and--aside from a fun cameo from John Carpenter himself--an inherently disposable cast of characters.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-thing-remastered-review-cold-fear/1900-6418323/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",

It has taken ML approaches just a couple of years to match, and in some cases surpass, the skill of these traditional models.”</p>\n<p>\\\nNow, Google DeepMind scientists have developed a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/07/22/google-ai-weather-climate-forecast-model\">weather model</a> that largely beats the world’s most accurate modeling system. </p>\n<p>\\\nResearchers believe the model may be able to accurately predict unprecedented events that climate change accentuates.</p>\n<p>\\\nAccording to a report last month <a href=\"https://iccwbo.org/news-publications/policies-reports/new-report-extreme-weather-events-cost-economy-2-trillion-over-the-last-decade/\">commissioned by the International Chamber of Commerce</a>, “climate-related extreme weather events have cost the global economy more than $2 trillion over the past decade.”</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://www.maginative.com/article/gencast-a-new-weather-ai-from-google-deepmind-outperforms-leading-weather-forecasting-systems/\">According to Maginative</a>, “Google DeepMind’s new high-resolution AI model, GenCast, delivers faster, more accurate weather predictions than traditional methods. AI will fundamentally change how we plan for everyday weather and extreme events.”</p>\n<p>\\\nPart of the reason why this is such a significant development is because GenCast offers weather forecasts that are not only more reliable but also faster. Unlike traditional methods that rely on supercomputers and take hours, GenCast runs on a single TPU chip in just eight minutes, predicting a wide range of possible outcomes rather than a single scenario, as current weather prediction models do.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn contrast to traditional models, which make forecasts by solving physics equations, GenCast learns directly from historical weather data.</p>\n<p>\\\nJacob Mallinder, in CEO Today,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ceotodaymagazine.com/2024/12/9-must-know-ai-weather-forecasting-innovations/\">outlines some of the top AI innovations</a>&nbsp;that are&nbsp;making a difference in weather forecasting today.</p>\n<p>\\\nHe explains that aside from improved data gathering and predictive analytics, AI today allows for insight into climate change, agricultural optimization, improving efficiency in the energy sector, and enhancing aviation safety.</p>\n<p>\\\nMAELSTROM is another <a href=\"https://www.maelstrom-eurohpc.eu/\">large-scale R&D project</a>, aiming to fundamentally improve weather and climate prediction. It aims to combine the powers of high-performance computing (HPC) and ML to cope with the extreme complexity inherent in weather and climate forecasts.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn August, NVIDIA Research <a href=\"https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2024-08_kilometer-scale-convection-allowing-model-emulation-using-generative-diffusion\">announced a new generative AI model</a>, dubbed StormCast, for emulating high-fidelity atmospheric dynamics.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe model was built to provide reliable weather prediction at the mesoscale — a scale larger than storms but smaller than cyclones — which is critical for disaster planning and mitigation.</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://quantumcomputingreport.com/quantum-for-ai-weather-forecasting-are-we-there-yet/\">Quantum ML is another option</a>, but some experts believe it is not the optimal way to go as quantum computing is still in the early stages of development.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf it is the case that GenCast and other emerging technologies can predict serious weather events, it will introduce a monumental change. With such abilities, we can warn people ahead of time and prevent traffic accidents. Farmers can plan their farming and prevent crop loss. Energy companies will be able to run more effectively if they can understand sun and wind patterns in advance.</p>\n<p>\\\nAnd when we walk out the door, we won’t need to wonder what the weather will be like because we’ll already know.</p>",

Around half of Cuba's power generation facilities are offline for maintenance or broken down. All are decades old and producing well under capacity. \n\nAs a result, a majority of Cuba's residents suffer hours-long, rolling blackouts on a daily basis even when the grid is functional. Cuba's electrical grid has been on the brink of collapse for years, as fuel shortages, a string of natural disasters and an economic crisis have left the island's government unable to maintain the system's decrepit infrastructure. Dwindling oil imports from Venezuela, Russia and Mexico tipped the system into full crisis this year, leading to several nationwide blackouts that have sparked unrest and increasing anger among the population. The blackouts, together with food, medicine and water shortages, have vastly complicated life on the island and driven a record-breaking exodus of its residents since 2020. \n\nAuthorities informed Cuba's citizens that scheduled power outages will now resume, reports ABC News. \"Cuban authorities said they will continue their current practice of implementing daily, five-hour power outages by block or zone as they have been doing for the past few months.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Millions+of+Cubans+Had+Another+Power+Outage+Wednesday%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F220211%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F220211%2Fmillions-of-cubans-had-another-power-outage-wednesday%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/24/12/05/220211/millions-of-cubans-had-another-power-outage-wednesday?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23542899&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

The coin’s value quickly climbed to nearly $500 million, but within 20 minutes, it plummeted by 88%, dropping to around $66 million in total value. The crypto community on X is in an uproar, with some claiming that Hailey is responsible for what they’re calling a “rug pull” — a project intentionally abandoned by its developers to run off with investor money.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-46536fy.png\" alt=\"$Hawk takes a steep dive\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nSome speculate that, since Hailey just got familiar with the power of crypto and was “orange-pilled” (converted into a serious Bitcoin advocate) only a few weeks ago, she was likely taken advantage of by those more experienced in the tokenomics of launching a successful project. The theory? Her team or advisers may have orchestrated the whole thing to run off with millions of dollars after the token’s value crashed.</p>\n<p>\\\nHailey took to X Spaces, an open audio group chat, to share her side of the story. The Space, cheekily titled&nbsp;<em>The Hawk Truth,</em>&nbsp;featured little commentary from Hailey herself. Instead, an alleged project organizer known as @overHeRE on X defended the project, claiming it was not a rug pull and insisting that Hailey and her team are not abandoning the project. </p>\n<p>\\\nAccording to community notes on X: “96% of the $HAWK supply is in 10 connected addresses before the launch.” Suggesting that Hailey’s team has nearly total control over the sustaining value of the coin.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis story is very much ongoing. Some people claim to have lost their life savings and sizable investments on the token, expecting the memecoin to make them major profits. Naturally, these investors are upset and regretful, while more seasoned crypto traders are scolding anyone naive enough to invest in a “Hawk Tuah” memecoin.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whenusersinthedigitaltownhallaccusedhaileyandquestionedherabouthowmuchmoneywasmadeduringtheriseandfallofhernewtokenhaileyinterjectedsaying\">When users in the digital town hall accused Hailey and questioned her about how much money was made during the rise and fall of her new token, Hailey interjected, saying,</h2>\n<p>\\\n<em><a href=\"https://youtu.be/4IVpzmkHBEU?si=cHfBxreMGMFvKerp&t=3784\">“Hey guys, I hate to interrupt you, but anywho, I’m going to bed.

It's the first time when MachineGames breaks loose from its linear shackles, presenting you with a massive play area to freely explore. I went from gawking at Michelangelo's masterpiece on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel to exploring the ancient ruins hidden deep beneath the holy city, spending more than three hours on this single level alone without coming close to completing every task in Indy's journal.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">It's not quite what I expected from a studio known for its frenetic shooters, nor a game that's been described as a first-person action-adventure. For the most part, The Great Circle is a stealth game that resembles Dishonored more than any of MachineGames' previous output. Sure, you could skulk through the shadows in Wolfenstein, plunging knives into Nazi spines, but it was a shooter first and foremost. The Great Circle has moments of action, but its violence is sudden and tends to end quickly, indicative of Indiana Jones as a character; it wouldn't make sense if he were running and gunning like BJ Blazkowicz. It's a refreshing change of pace for the studio, and it's a rip-roaring good time, even if the inexperience of creating this sort of game sometimes shows.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In terms of story and tone, MachineGames definitely understood the assignment. The Great Circle's prologue is essentially a love letter to Raiders of the Lost Ark, immediately making it clear how much the studio both grasps and reveres the series and its globe-trotting protagonist. This feeling persists throughout the entire game, beginning with an opening level that takes place inside the fictional walls of Marshall College, where Indy teaches archeology. The Great Circle is set between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, weaving into the existing fabric of the series in a way that makes it feel like a natural extension of Indy's story. A few familiar faces return, and new characters seamlessly blend into its cinematic world, contributing to a compelling adventure that sees you travel the world, uncover ancient mysteries, and butt heads with the Axis powers.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",

      "content": "Today a group of German scientists presented data suggesting Earth is absorbing more sunlight than in the past, reports Ars Technica, \"largely due to reduced cloud cover.\"\n\n\nWe can measure both the amount of energy the Earth receives from the Sun and how much energy it radiates back into space.... The new paper finds that the energy imbalance set a new high in 2023, with a record amount of energy being absorbed by the ocean/atmosphere system. This wasn't accompanied by a drop in infrared emissions from the Earth, suggesting it wasn't due to greenhouse gases, which trap heat by absorbing this radiation. Instead, it seems to be due to decreased reflection of incoming sunlight by the Earth.... \n\nUsing two different data sets, the teams identify the areas most effected by this, and they're not at the poles, indicating loss of snow and ice are unlikely to be the cause. Instead, the key contributor appears to be the loss of low-level clouds [particularly over the Atlantic ocean]... The drop in low-level clouds had been averaging about 1.3 percent per decade. 2023 saw a slightly larger drop occur in just one year.... \n\nSo, what could be causing the clouds to go away? The researchers list three potential factors. One is simply the variability of the climate system, meaning 2023 might have just been an extremely unusual year, and things will revert to trends in the ensuing years. The second is the impact of aerosols, which both we and natural processes emit in copious quantities. These can help seed clouds, so a reduction of aerosols (driven by things like pollution control measures) could potentially account for this effect. The most concerning potential explanation, however, is that there may be a feedback relationship between rising temperatures and low-level clouds. Meaning that, as the Earth warms, the clouds become sparse, enhancing the warming further. That would be bad news for our future climate, because it suggests that the lower range of warming estimates would have to be adjusted upward to account for it. \n\nIf the decline in reflectivity wasn't just caused by normal variability, the researchers warn, \"the 2023 extra heat may be here to stay...\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Earth+Began+Absorbing+More+Sunlight+in+2023%2C+Climate+Researchers+Find%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F2324206%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F2324206%2Fearth-began-absorbing-more-sunlight-in-2023-climate-researchers-find%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/05/2324206/earth-began-absorbing-more-sunlight-in-2023-climate-researchers-find?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23542979&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

      "content": "Wednesday OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced \"12 Days of OpenAI,\" promising that \"Each weekday, we will have a livestream with a launch or demo...\" And sure enough, today he announced the launch of two things: \n- \"o1, the smartest model in the world. Smarter, faster, and more features (e.g. multimodality) than o1-preview. Live in ChatGPT now, coming to API soon.\" \n\n- \"ChatGPT Pro. $200/month. Unlimited usage and even-smarter mode for using o1. More benefits to come!\" \n\nAltman added this update later:\nFor extra clarity: o1 is available in our plus tier, for $20/month. With the new pro tier ($200/month), it can think even harder for the hardest problems. Most users will be very happy with o1 in the plus tier! \n VentureBeat points out that subscribers \"also gain access to GPT-4o, known for its advanced natural language generation capabilities, and the Advanced Voice feature for speech-based interactions.\" \n\nAnd even for non-subscribers, ChatGPT can now also analyze images, points out VentureBeat, \"a hugely helpful feature upgrade as it enables users to upload photos and have the AI chatbot respond to them, giving them detailed plans on how to build a birdhouse entirely from a single candid photo of one, for one fun example.\"\n\nIn another, potentially more serious and impressive example, it is now capable of helping design data centers from sketches... o1 represents a significant evolution in reasoning model capabilities, including better handling of complex tasks, image-based reasoning, and enhanced accuracy. Enterprise and Education users will gain access to the model next week... OpenAI's updates also include safety enhancements, with the o1-preview scoring 84 on a rigorous safety test, compared to 22 for its predecessor... \n\nTo encourage the use of AI in societal-benefit fields, OpenAI has announced the ChatGPT Pro Grant Program. The initiative will initially award 10 grants to leading medical researchers, providing free access to ChatGPT Pro tools.\n \nIn a video Altman displays graphs showing o1 dramatically outperforms gpt4o on math questions, on competition coding at CodeForces, and on PhD-level science questions.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=OpenAI+Releases+'Smarter%2C+Faster'+ChatGPT+-+Plus+%24200-a-Month+Subscriptions+for+'Even-Smarter+Mode'%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F06%2F0121217%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F06%2F0121217%2Fopenai-releases-smarter-faster-chatgpt---plus-200-a-month-subscriptions-for-even-smarter-mode%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://slashdot.org/story/24/12/06/0121217/openai-releases-smarter-faster-chatgpt---plus-200-a-month-subscriptions-for-even-smarter-mode?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23543071&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

Even more so, she leveraged and monetized it.</p>\n<p>\\\nShe sold branded merchandise, launched the “Talk Tuah” podcast, and was paid to appear at different events.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thememecoin\">The Memecoin</h2>\n<p>Hawk Tuah became one of the most popular memes, and a few months later, it was also going to become a memecoin too…</p>\n<p>\\\nWhat’s the big deal though?</p>\n<p>\\\nCelebrity tokens and memecoins are launched too often these days. Most of them are rugs, majority of those celebrities are grifters… It’s an old story - who cares, right?</p>\n<p>\\\nWell, many cared enough to put their money into $Hawk, and … yup (spoiler alert), lost it.</p>\n<p>\\\nAt this point, unfortunately, that’s not surprising at all though…</p>\n<p>\\\nAnyway, let’s check what happened with this one.</p>\n<p>\\\nAt the end of last month, Hailey let everyone know that she was launching a memecoin on Dec 4th.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhere?</p>\n<p>\\\nOf course where the epicenter of the degen shitshow is: Solana (in my opinion, exactly where her shitcoin belonged…). </p>\n<p>\\\nShe started collecting SOL wallet addresses for free airdrop…</p>\n<p>\\\nThen, the 4th of December came, and she tweeted a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/HalieyWelchX/status/1864434514610782583\">3 sec video</a>&nbsp;saying the coin was live.</p>\n<p>\\\nAnd then…</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/sZgLpNbOPtQFz0sTBASstUpb7kG2-cs0340y.png\" alt=\"\" />This happened…</p>\n<p>\\\nThe drop was so steep and fast that the memecoin degens who put their hopes of getting a Lambo on $HAWK profits ended up being the exit liquidity…</p>\n<p>\\\nProbably they’re already used to it by now…I’ve even heard some say it’s “part of the game”, but still, even if they ask for it - they may not deserve it… or … do they?</p>\n<h2 id=\"thetokenomics\">The Tokenomics</h2>\n<p>For those who have seen similar charts and still have no clue what happens behind the scenes - here is the summary of what seems to have happened in this particular case.</p>\n<p>\\\nLet’s look at “tokenomics” (I can imagine the talks about it among the team while coming up with the numbers lol…)</p>\n<p>\\\nHayley was told&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/HalieyWelchX/status/1864448384326881713\">to copy and paste it for us guys</a>&nbsp;:)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/sZgLpNbOPtQFz0sTBASstUpb7kG2-7u134b3.png\" alt=\"\" />So, here it is.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/sZgLpNbOPtQFz0sTBASstUpb7kG2-qb234xi.png\" alt=\"\" />According to the team, those 17% were SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) - basically presale…</p>\n<p>\\\nBut who in their right mind makes those FULLY UNLOCKED?…</p>\n<p>\\\nMeaning those who get them can dump those tokens at the same minute they are issued … which is exactly what it feels like they did.</p>\n<p>\\\nNow, that’s what the team says… which may or may not be true.</p>\n<p>\\\nHaving them unlocked is already bad enough… but hey, we’re in crypto - who knows who those wallets belong to… maybe the team rolled out a few hundred wallets themselves?…</p>\n<p>\\\nNot saying that’s the case - all I am saying is we can see which are those wallets, but there is no way to prove who they belong to - is there?</p>\n<p>\\\nWhoever those wallets belonged to - they already made tons of money at this point.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong><em>Now, compare that 17% to the miserable 2% allocated to the public sale…</em></strong></p>\n<p>\\\nOne doesn’t have to be a rocket scientist to know how wrong and how fast this could go, right?</p>\n<p>\\\nOk, so now add to it the fact that many were not even able to get anything from that 2%.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhy?</p>\n<p>\\\nWell because a sniper jumped in, sniped most of it - and then immediately sold it … walking out with millions (unlike you guys - he can now buy a Lambo!)</p>\n<p>\\\nWho else made millions although it might look like they themselves did not sell a single token?</p>\n<p>\\\nThe team.</p>\n<p>\\\nLooks like they had a fee set - which means that thanks to the sniper and other trades they too made a substantial amount in fees.</p>\n<p>\\\nSo, all these people above made millions… sorry to say - at the expense of those who aped into $HAWK.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/sZgLpNbOPtQFz0sTBASstUpb7kG2-cl334mi.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"theiconicxspace\">The “Iconic” X Space</h2>\n<p>At some point, degens realized what happened and obviously, the accusations about the whole thing being a rug emerged. Most of their tweets got community noted to warn those who were still unaware.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/sZgLpNbOPtQFz0sTBASstUpb7kG2-724340e.png\" alt=\"\" />Of course, everyone was waiting for a reaction, response, and comms from the team.</p>\n<p>\\\nAnd they eventually got what they were waiting for - X space with Hailey and co…</p>\n<p>\\\nWhich was later deleted from their accounts…</p>\n<p>\\\nWas that because it was a complete disaster?</p>\n<p>\\\nMaybe…</p>\n<p>\\\nBut hey - we all know nothing disappears from the internet right?</p>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://x.com/TheTylerBueno/status/1864562868852584549\">Here is the full recording for you</a></p>\n<p>\\\nBelow is a short recap:</p>\n<p>\\\nIt started by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/DocHollywoodArt\">the “dev,”</a>&nbsp;or whoever in the team he was, who spoke for the first 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>\\\nHere are a few messages that stood out from his “speech”:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>You are not the target audience - this is not for crypto crowd but rather her fans</em></li>\n<li><em>If you guys are in crypto, you probably are mentally ill</em></li>\n<li><em>You guys should be kissing my fucking ass…</em></li>\n<li><em>Most of you, we don’t want you in the community - you’re not great people</em></li>\n<li><em>Send it to 0 couldn’t care less ….</em></li>\n<li><em>Hawk Tuah is a cultural meme - this is not a celebrity token</em></li>\n<li><em>You can go post shitty charts all day doesn’t fucking matter I don’t give a shit</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\n<a href=\"https://x.com/coffeebreak_YT\">Coffeezilla</a>&nbsp;came on stage to ask questions and share his viewpoint. He was talked over and they kept muting him.</p>\n<p>\\\nSo, he left and opened&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/coffeebreak_YT/status/1864555380606431303\">his own space</a>&nbsp;called Straight Tuah Jail -</p>\n<p>\\\nFunnily enough, there is a Straight Tuah Prison (TUAH) token now out there… (don’t think it’s related to the space though:)</p>\n<p>\\\nIn short, none of the questions were addressed.</p>\n<p>\\\nThere were talks about a registered foundation in the Cayman Islands, the costs paid for the foundation being $1m (not sure for what - director salaries, legal? Was not clear), them NOT going anywhere, etc…</p>\n<p>\\\nHailey kept saying she’s just here to have fun and pretended she did not understand much about the crypto space but learning every day… The “iconic” space shut down as soon as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/chooserich\">Nick</a>&nbsp;asked how much the team was being paid because&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/chooserich/status/1864710801149329908\">Hailey interrupted mid-sentence</a>&nbsp;saying “Anywho I’m gonna go to bed I’ll see you guys tomorrow…”</p>\n<h2 id=\"aftermath\">Aftermath</h2>\n<p>Let’s see what happens tomorrow when Hawk Tuah girl wakes up …</p>\n<p>\\\nThis is not the first story… and it’s not gonna be the last either.</p>\n<p>\\\nJust like in all of those, there was a small group of people who made millions at the expense of many people who lost.</p>\n<p>\\\nNo one felt accountable.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis too will probably be forgotten.</p>\n<p>\\\nSimilar stories with the same outcome but different flavors will still be happening…</p>\n<p>\\\nSo, I guess I’ll “meet” you here when I write the next one :)</p>\n<p>\\\nP.S.

      "content": "\"Okay, we're doing this,\" begins a new announcement at The Verge:\n\nToday we're launching a Verge subscription that lets you get rid of a bunch of ads, gets you unlimited access to our top-notch reporting and analysis across the site and our killer premium newsletters, and generally lets you support independent tech journalism in a world of sponsored influencer content. It'll cost $7 / month or $50 / year &mdash; and for a limited time, if you sign up for the annual plan, we'll send you an absolutely stunning print edition of our CONTENT GOBLINS series, with very fun new photography and design... A surprising number of you have asked us to launch something like this, and we're happy to deliver. If you don't want to pay, rest assured that big chunks of The Verge will remain free &mdash; we're thinking about subscriptions a lot differently than everyone else... \n\nIf you're a Verge reader, you know we've been covering massive, fundamental changes to how the internet works for years now. Most major social media platforms are openly hostile to links, huge changes to search have led to the death of small websites, and everything is covered in a layer of AI slop and weird scams. The algorithmic media ecosystem is now openly hostile to the kind of rigorous, independent journalism we want to do. \n\nA few years ago, we decided the only real way to survive all this was to stand apart and bet on our own website so that we could remain independent of these platforms and their algorithms. We didn't want to write stories to chase Google Search trends or because we thought they'd do well on social media. And we definitely didn't want to compromise our famously strict ethics policy to accept brand endorsement deals from the companies we cover, which almost all of our competitors in the creator economy are forced to do in order to run sustainable businesses... \n\n[W]e intend to keep making this thing together for a long, long time. So many of you like The Verge that we've actually gotten a shocking number of notes from people asking how they can pay to support our work. It's no secret that lots of great websites and publications have gone under over the past few years as the open web falls apart, and it's clear that directly supporting the creators you love is a big part of how everyone gets to stay working on the modern internet. At the same time, we didn't want to simply paywall the entire site &mdash; it's a tragedy that traditional journalism is retreating behind paywalls while nonsense spreads across platforms for free. \n\nThe print premium for subscribers is described as a \"beautiful / deranged print product\" that's drawn from a series of articles \"about what Google had done to the web, capped off by a feature about search engine optimization titled 'The People Who Ruined the Internet.'\"\nBut it ships with a satirical cover that instead proclaims it as \"The Verge Guide to Search Engine Optimization\". A tongue-in-check announcement explains:\n\n[A] year has passed, and we've had a change of heart. Maybe search engine optimization is actually a good thing. Maybe appeasing the search algorithm is not only a sustainable strategy for building a loyal audience, but also a strategic way to plan and produce content. What are journalists, if not content creators? Anyway, SEO community, consider this our apology. And what better way to say \"our bad, your industry is not a cesspool of AI slop but a brilliant vision of what a useful internet could look like\" than collecting all the things we've learned in one handy print magazine? Which is why I'm proud to introduce The Verge Guide to Search Engine Optimization: All the Tips, Tricks, Hints, Schemes, and Techniques for Promoting High-Quality Content! \t \nWhoops &mdash; slip off the cover and the real title appears: \"CONTENT GOBLINS\" (written in green slime). Again, it's \"an anthology of stories about 'content' and the people who 'make' it.\"\n\nIn very Verge fashion, we are meeting the moment where the internet has been overrun by AI garbage by publishing a beautifully designed, limited edition print product. (Also, the last time we printed a magazine, it won a very prestigious design award.) Content Goblins collects some of our best stories over the past couple years, capturing the cynical push for the world's great art and journalism to be reduced into units that can be packaged, distributed, and consumed on the internet. Consider Content Goblins as our resistance to that movement. With terrific new art and photography, we're making the case that great reporting is vital and enduring &mdash; and worth paying for. \n\nThis gorgeous, grotesque magazine can be yours if you commit to an annual subscription to The Verge &mdash; while supplies last.\n<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=The+Verge+Explains+Why%2C+After+13+Years%2C+It's+Offering+a+'Subscription'+Option+for+Its+Supporters%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F04%2F1959245%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F04%2F1959245%2Fthe-verge-explains-why-after-13-years-its-offering-a-subscription-option-for-its-supporters%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/04/1959245/the-verge-explains-why-after-13-years-its-offering-a-subscription-option-for-its-supporters?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23541687&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

      "content": "<p>After years in JavaScript's endless sea of competing packages, Elixir's ecosystem feels like a breath of fresh air. Instead of evaluating 15 different libraries for each function, Elixir typically offers one or two battle-tested solutions per problem domain. This focused approach means each tool is well-maintained, thoroughly documented, and production-proven.</p>\n<p>\\\nLet me share my favorite libraries that make Elixir development a joy, especially from the npm world of decision paralysis. Each tool solves a problem elegantly without trying to be everything to everyone, and I’m here for that. Anyone else?</p>\n<h2 id=\"thegamechangers\"><strong>The Game-Changers</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"backgroundjobsallthelovetooban\"><strong>Background Jobs: All the Love to Oban</strong></h3>\n<p>Coming from Sidekiq in Ruby and Bull in Node.js, <strong><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/oban-bg/oban\">Oban</a></strong></strong> was a revelation. It's the only job processor I've used that leverages PostgreSQL instead of requiring Redis – this architectural choice means your jobs are transactionally consistent with your data. With 3.4k GitHub stars, it's clear I'm not alone in appreciating this solution.</p>\n<p>\\\nI particularly love how it handles job persistence. When our application crashed in Node.js, we'd lose in-memory jobs. With Oban, they survive restarts because they're stored right in PostgreSQL. The recent MySQL support shows they're thinking about broader adoption too.</p>\n<h3 id=\"graphqldonerightabsinthe\"><strong>GraphQL Done Right: Absinthe</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe\">Absinthe</a></strong></strong> feels like coming home if you've wrestled with GraphQL implementations in other languages. With 4.3k GitHub stars, it's not just popular – it's the standard. What makes it special isn't just the comprehensive feature set but how naturally it integrates with Elixir's concurrency model. Field resolution can be async by default, and the <strong><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/97197/what-is-the-n1-selects-problem-in-orm-object-relational-mapping\">N+1 query problem</a></strong> just… disappears.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thedailyworkhorses\"><strong>The Daily Workhorses</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"datahandlinggodblessflop\"><strong>Data Handling: God Bless Flop</strong></h3>\n<p>Remember writing custom pagination and filtering over and over? <strong><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/woylie/flop\">Flop</a></strong></strong> ended that tedium for me. With both offset and cursor-based pagination built-in and a filtering system that makes sense, it's become my go-to for any data-heavy interface. The fact that it works seamlessly with Phoenix makes it even better – the pre-built components save hours of development time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dataencryptioncloakspracticalmagic\"><strong>Data Encryption: Cloak's Practical Magic</strong></h3>\n<p>After struggling with attr_encrypted in Ruby and TypeORM encryption in Node.js, I found exactly what I needed in <strong><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/danielberkompas/cloak\">Cloak</a></strong></strong>. What sets it apart (and earned it that 9.0/6.3 <strong><a href=\"https://elixir.libhunt.com/categories/689-cryptography\">rating on LibHunt</a></strong>) is how it makes encrypted data actually usable. You can search through encrypted fields – a feature that blew my mind when I first discovered it. The GDPR compliance support isn't just a checkbox feature; it's deeply integrated into how Cloak handles data. And when you need to rotate encryption keys (and you will), Cloak makes it painless instead of panic-inducing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multitenancytriplexismypainkiller\"><strong>Multi-tenancy: Triplex Is My Painkiller</strong></h3>\n<p>Multi-tenancy used to give me nightmares until I found <strong><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/ateliware/triplex\">Triplex</a></strong></strong>. Its use of PostgreSQL schemas for tenant isolation is brilliant – it's like each tenant gets their private database but without the operational overhead. The way it maintains the familiar Ecto query interface means you barely have to think about the multi-tenant aspect while coding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thequalityoflifeimprovers\"><strong>The Quality-of-Life Improvers</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"cachingwhycachexstandsout\"><strong>Caching: Why Cachex Stands Out</strong></h3>\n<p>After trying various caching solutions across different languages, <strong><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/whitfin/cachex\">Cachex</a></strong></strong>'s approach just clicks. For a good reason, it's the highest-rated caching solution on LibHunt (9.7/10). The combination of time-based expiration, size limits, and transaction support covers every caching scenario I've encountered. The cache warming strategies have saved us during high-traffic events multiple times.</p>\n<h3 id=\"jwthandlingjokensfocusedapproach\"><strong>JWT Handling: Joken's Focused Approach</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/joken-elixir/joken\">Joken</a></strong> is a perfect example of the Elixir ecosystem's philosophy: do one thing and do it well. It's not trying to be a complete auth solution – instead, it focuses on JWT handling and does it perfectly. The built-in security features and flexible integration options make token management a piece of cake.</p>\n<h3 id=\"httpclientreqisbatteryincluded\"><strong>HTTP Client: Req Is Battery-Included</strong></h3>\n<p>While HTTPoison <strong><a href=\"https://elixir.libhunt.com/categories/4974-http-client\">dominates the LibHunt ratings</a></strong>, I've fallen in love with <strong><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/wojtekmach/req\">Req</a></strong></strong>'s approach. Its batteries-included philosophy means I spend less time configuring and more time building. The automatic retries and response handling just work, and the pluggable architecture makes customization straightforward when needed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"awsintegrationexawsmakescloudsimple\"><strong>AWS Integration: ExAws Makes Cloud Simple</strong></h3>\n<p><strong><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/ex-aws/ex_aws\">ExAws</a></strong></strong> (1.3k stars) transformed my thoughts about AWS integration in Elixir. Its modular approach means you only include the services you need, keeping your dependencies lean. The consistent API patterns across different AWS services make it feel like you're working with native Elixir code rather than wrestling with AWS peculiarities.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/1fq1znkuBWaNW9Ozxi9L8O2MtfI3-3d034om.png\" alt=\"9 open-source Elixir tools to build your SaaS\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"whythismatters\"><strong>Why This Matters</strong></h2>\n<p>The beauty of Elixir's ecosystem isn't just in the individual tools but in how they work together.&nbsp; I absolutely love that I can build a complete, production-ready application using only Elixir. There's no decision fatigue, no compatibility nightmares, just solid, focused solutions that solve real problems. Coming from ecosystems where you might spend days just choosing packages, this clarity is refreshing.</p>\n<p>\\\nWhat's your experience with these tools? Have they changed how you think about building Elixir applications? I'd love to hear your stories and discoveries in the comments.</p>",

It is known that the governments of the United States, China, Germany, Ukraine, and other countries possess significant crypto holdings.</p>\n<p>\\\nThe formalisation of strategy had remained forgotten until Trump’s victory reawakened debates about using Bitcoin as a core asset for the U.S. strategic reserve. In fact, this became a more tangible concept, as the majority of Congress seats were taken by pro-crypto senators.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The Trump administration understands it, I think Senator Lummis understands it…that’s why it will happen,”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>– believes Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy executive chairman and a renowned Bitcoin maxi.</p>\n<p>\\\nNational crypto reserve is only one of the elements reflecting possible U.S. administration’s course to elaborating crypto regulation.

Among them are 62 public companies, such as Reddit and Tesla.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"solanainspotlightweb3dominanceandaiagents\">Solana in spotlight, Web3-dominance, and AI Agents</h2>\n<p>The attention to blockchain protocols has been exponentially growing since autumn.</p>\n<p>\\\nFirstly, Firedancer came into play. Dubbed as “Frankendancer”, this prototype of a validator has sent shockwaves throughout the community by managing to process over 1 million transactions per second. But crucially, it spurred the l1 token market, already heated enough ahead of a so-called altseason – a period of all-at-once surge for the altcoins.</p>\n<p>\\\nAs a result, Solana’s total value locked (TVL) is at its peak of $8 billion. Apart from technological advancements, it was also boosted thanks to memecoins popularity. According to CoinMarketCap, the ecosystem’s capitalisation has <strong><a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/view/solana-ecosystem/\">grown</a></strong> 28% since the beginning of Q4, as top Solana-based ‘memes’ capitalisation <strong><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/solana-meme-coins\">surged</a></strong> nearly 300% since July.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/y2n4tY4QzFMf0GccUNg9hyQFUR03-0p236hp.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\n\\\n\\\nSolana’s enhanced position in the market paved a way north for other Web3 solutions. Layer one solution Sui has seen a record $1.5 billion TVL, as its native SUI token grew over 110% since October 1. Meanwhile, WBT – a centrepiece of the Whitechain network – has managed to secure almost 2x growth for the Q4, securing a $3 billion-sized market capitalisation.</p>\n<p>\\\nApart from L1s, artificial intelligence (AI) is slowly taking centre stage as the leading technology in the market. Specifically, with the AI agents becoming in demand.</p>\n<p>\\\nAI agents operate with goal-oriented autonomy and multi-step decision-making. This allows them to evaluate conditions dynamically, make nuanced choices, and engage in economic and social interactions across on-chain and off-chain platforms.</p>\n<p>\\\nAccording to Blockhead, this flexibility <strong><a href=\"https://www.blockhead.co/2024/11/16/ai-managed-fund-ai16z-takes-crypto-by-storm-hits-200m-market-cap-2/\">makes</a></strong> AI agents particularly suited for crypto, a space that demands agility and rapid decision-making due to its inherent volatility and decentralized nature.</p>\n<p>\\n Such shift is underscored by the success stories of AI agents like Terminal of Truths and the explosive growth of the memecoins $GOAT and Centience ($CENTS), and now, an AI-powered VC – ai16z. The latter one scored 694% in only a week.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"lastfomcmeetingof2024andaltseason\">Last FOMC Meeting of 2024 and Altseason</h2>\n<p>Market expectations are high as never before – perhaps, just like the importance of the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) December meeting. One will not only reveal the interest rates, but set the course for next year’s macroeconomy and hence crypto market.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/y2n4tY4QzFMf0GccUNg9hyQFUR03-fi036rn.jpeg\" alt=\"Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference at the end of the two-day FOMC meeting on March 20, 2024. Source: CNN\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThe outlooks are generally positive, as since the initial September historic cut by 50 basis points (bps), the rates were diminished by 20 bps again in November. Such a tendency has been bringing a sequential liquidity flow into the global cryptocurrency market, while the potential impact from December cuts may be even more pronounced.</p>\n<p>\\\nThis influx of capital, which the last FOMC meeting of 2024 may bring, coupled with a more favourable macroeconomic environment, could ignite a bullish wave, positioning 2025 as a year of resurgence.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf the FOMC signals a pivot toward easing monetary policy, it might catalyse renewed confidence in crypto markets, unlocking dormant capital and fueling a rally akin to the prior economic expansions. The December meeting thus becomes not just a pivotal moment for traditional markets but a harbinger for crypto’s next big leap.</p>\n<p>\\\nMost importantly, the expectations remain positive, as the majority of investors expect a 25 bps cut in December.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/y2n4tY4QzFMf0GccUNg9hyQFUR03-zg1369v.jpeg\" alt=\"Target rate probabilities for December FOMC meeting.

      "content": "The use of lead in gasoline \"might have harmed the mental health of a generation,\" reports USA Today.\n\n\nGen X bears an extra burden of conditions such as depression, anxiety, ADHD and neurotic behavior because of the leaded gasoline they were exposed to as children, according to a study published Wednesday in the peer-reviewed Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry. Leaded gas was banned in the United States in 1996, but the study said years of exposure during development made them particularly vulnerable. \n\nLead gas peaked from the mid-1960s through the mid-1970s, and children born during that era would later develop some of the highest rates of mental health symptoms, the study said. The study also linked leaded gas to \"disadvantageous\" traits, such as struggling to concentrate, stay on task or organizing thoughts. \"I tend to think of Generation X as 'generation lead,'\" said Aaron Reuben, a study co-author and assistant professor of clinical neuropsychology at the University of Virginia. \"We know they were exposed to it more and we're estimating they have gone on to have higher rates of internalizing conditions like anxiety, depression and symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder....\" \n\nResearchers linked the lead exposure to an estimated 151 million \"excess mental disorders\" in the United States over the 75-year period. The estimates should be \"considered a floor\" because it relies mainly on gas and not exposure from lead in paint and pipes, Reuben said... Those born between 1966 and 1986 generally had higher mental illness levels linked to lead exposure with the rates peaking for those born between 1966 and 1970, the study said. Those rates coincided with the peak use of lead in gas from the mid-1960s through the mid-1970s... The study said the peak lead use coincided with increased demand for psychiatric care and higher rates of juvenile delinquency.\n \n Today there's routine blood screenings for high levels of lead, study co-author Reuben says.

The company's innovative approach analyzes user’s blockchain activity to deliver hyper-targeted advertisements while prioritizing user privacy and data protection. Today, Slise ads reach <strong>more than 6 million active crypto-users</strong> and count the largest brands in the space including <strong>PayPal, MetaMask, Revolut</strong>, and <strong>OKX</strong> among its clients.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/GA37V9HtdQeZRkvZVKt8pteCVhD2-sq136vf.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nThis acquisition marks a significant step forward for W3M Ventures as it continues to expand its vision for decentralized advertising technology. The company has interests in various Web3 and crypto adtech platforms including <strong>AADS</strong>, the oldest traditional ad network in the crypto space.</p>\n<p>\\\n\"==<em>The acquisition of Slise represents a pivotal moment in our journey to revolutionize digital advertising for the Web3 era</em>==<em>,</em>\" the spokesperson for W3M Ventures said. \"<em>Their groundbreaking technology aligns perfectly with our vision of creating <strong>more effective, privacy-centric advertising solutions for the decentralized web.</strong></em>\"</p>\n<p>\\\nOleksii Sidorov, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Slise, added, \"<strong><em>W3M Ventures is the perfect catalyst for Slise’s growth</em></strong> <em>as they have experience and resources to accelerate the adoption of onchain data in digital advertising space for <strong>a more fair and transparent future</strong>. The team and I couldn’t be more excited to make our contribution to this change.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\\\nReflecting on the journey, Oleksii shares insights into the growth and development of the company during crypto-winter:</p>\n<p>\\\n<em>“The beginning of Slise coincided with the collapse of Luna and later FTX which initiated a downturn of the crypto market. Economically, it didn’t make any sense, only our belief in the potential of onchain data for ads pushed us forward.</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>It wasn't a smooth journey, very few VCs shared our beliefs. Slise didn’t close huge rounds despite later having 6-digit revenue, neither did we receive countless grants, we were underdogs, surviving, while our token-first competitors raised tens of millions before even having a product.</em></p>\n<p>\\\n<em>I don’t think the crypto market incentivizes building good products. Only independent thinking from first principles took us where we are now. We’ve never sponsored a side event or entertained people on X, instead, we stayed frugal and focused on client acquisition and operational efficiency. This all helped us build a business value and a dominant market position which W3M Ventures acquires today.”</em></p>\n<p>\\\n==The integration of Slise into Web3 Media Ventures' portfolio is expected to be completed within the next quarter. Clients and partners can anticipate new, enhanced advertising experiences in the coming months. The Slise team will help transition the <a href=\"https://slise.xyz\">Slise.xyz</a> business under W3M Ventures management while the core personnel will continue working on its new non-competing product <a href=\"https://dise.app\">Dise.app</a> — an AI-powered Sales CRM for crypto teams on Telegram.==</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"aboutweb3mediaventures\">About Web3 Media Ventures</h3>\n<p><strong>Web3 Media Ventures</strong> is an investment firm with equity and digital asset holdings in Web3 and adtech platforms.

      "content": "<p>In this article, I will show you how you can test a restful “Get” method using the Robot Framework. If you are new to Robot Framework, please read the <a href=\"https://robotframework.org/\">doc</a> from the website to find out the setup guide. You can install Robot Framework using “pip install robotframework” in your command line. Please note that you must install pip on your system before running this command.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo write test cases in Robot Framework, you should create a file with .robot extension, then you can write your scenario in the file to be run.</p>\n<p>\\\nEach .robot file usually contains three main parts: Settings, Variables, and Test cases like the below image.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-dk034nd.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nIn settings, you can import the libraries, suit setup, and documentation. In the variables part, you can put your variables, and the scenarios are written in the test cases section.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo test a simple Get request, we should import “RequestsLibrary” in settings because we want to make a request. In test cases, first, we should define a keyword for our test scenario, and then we should write the test steps in the keyword’s scope. See the picture below:</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/null-ca234r3.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nLet’s automate a simple Get request together.</p>\n<p>\\\nSuppose we want to write a test case for the following curl. This test case will call the endpoint and assert whether:</p>\n<pre><code>1- The endpoint responds with 200.\n\n2- The response body contains “Google“ word.\n\n3- The value of Content-Type is “application/json” in response headers.\n</code></pre>\n<p>curl --location 'https://api.restful-api.dev/objects' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data ''</p>\n<p>\\\nThis is a simple request that returns some mobile names like the below picture:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/hSvanXy1MWOhRExFqw9MXJbKuTD3-b9135kf.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nIn this step, I am going to write a Robot Framework code to call the API and assert the response.</p>\n<p>\\\nFirst, I define a variable to hold the base address of the API. Second, I put the URI of the API in another variable. You may ask why I put the URI in another variable. You will get your answer in the creating get request step.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/hSvanXy1MWOhRExFqw9MXJbKuTD3-v4035p1.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nAs I mentioned earlier, it it important to choose a name for our keyword. I choose get_request for the keyword part and then write the codes in the keyword’s scope. To create a restful request, we should establish a session first. Robot Framework has a built-in function to establish a session, it is “Create Session”:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">Create Session    session_name    ${base_address}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nThen we can make a get request by using “Get Request“ built-in function:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">Get Request    session_name      ${uri}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nGet Request is a built-in function in Robot Framework that gets at least two arguments. This is why I put the URI in a separate variable. The code above calls the API and gets the response, so we must hold the response in a variable like:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">${resp}=    Get Request    session_name     ${uri}\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nGoing through the steps that I have mentioned so far, will make get request, call the API, and save the response in the “resp” variable. Now we have the response and are ready to do assertions. One of the assertions in Robot Framework is “Should Be Equal“ built-in function. It gets two arguments and compares them. If they are the same, the assertion will return true.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">Should Be Equal    ${resp.status_code}    200\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nNote that integers in Robot Framework are considered as strings and ${resp.status<em>code} is returned as an integer. For example, in the code line above, 200 is an integer but Robot Framework considers it as a string so you should convert ${resp.status</em>code} to a string to compare it with 200. The built-in function for converting an integer to a string is “Convert To String“.</p>\n<p>\\\nThrough the response of the API, we can get the response headers and response body by ${resp.headers} and ${resp.content} respectively. Once you have the body of the response and the headers of the response, you can assert them as well. For instance, suppose you want to check whether the response body contains a specific word “x“. It is possible to make this assertion by using a built-in function “Should Contain“.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">Should Contain    ${resp.content}    x\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nPlease note that ${resp.content} is the body of the response in bytes, so you should convert the word “x“ to byte to do the assertion. The built-in function for converting to byte is “Convert To Bytes“.</p>\n<p>\\\nTo assert the headers, we should capture all headers from the response. ${resp.headers} will capture all response headers as a dictionary. As a result, to assert a specific value, we should get the value from the headers dictionary by using the key(we know that the dictionary holds keys and the related values; we can access any value by the related key). This can be done by “Get From Dictionary“ built-in function.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">${content_type_value}=    Get From Dictionary     ${resp.headers}     Content-Type\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nNow we have the value of Content-Type header and we can assert it.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"javascript language-javascript\">Should Be Equal    ${content_type_value}    application/json\n</code></pre>\n<p>\\\nIn the picture below, you can see all the assertions at a glance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/hSvanXy1MWOhRExFqw9MXJbKuTD3-bc235q1.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\\nResources:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://restful-api.dev/\">https://restful-api.dev/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://robotframework.org/\">https://robotframework.org/</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Image header: by <a href=\"https://www.freepik.com/author/brgfx\">brgfx</a> on freepik</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\\</p>",

      "content": "<p>The goal of this article is to provide information to developers who are considering microservice integration using Event Driven Architecture and Messaging.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"context\"><strong>Context</strong></h2>\n<p>In a monolithic application, software components invoke one another using language-level methods or function calls, and the objects are typically running within the same process on the same server.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn a microservices architecture, components are distributed and can be run on multiple processes across multiple servers. They communicate with one another across a network using an&nbsp;<strong><em>inter-service communications protocol</em></strong>. There are several factors to consider when selecting an inter-service protocol. Messaging is one that can provide many advantages, but it's not always appropriate for every App.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"interservicecommunicationtypes\">Inter-Service Communication Types</h2>\n<p>The selection of an inter-service communication protocol should be made with consideration of the service's goals and use cases. They are classified as either synchronous or asynchronous and by the number of receivers (single or multiple).</p>\n<h3 id=\"synchronousorasynchronous\">Synchronous or Asynchronous</h3>\n<p>The first distinction between inter-service communication protocol types is whether they are synchronous or asynchronous.</p>\n<h3 id=\"synchronous\">Synchronous</h3>\n<p>In synchronous communication, the client sends a request and waits for a response from the service. The client code can only continue its task after it receives the server response. The protocol (HTTP/HTTPS) is synchronous.</p>\n<p>\\\nIf possible, avoid depending on synchronous communication (request/response) between multiple microservices, including for queries. Having HTTP dependencies between microservices not only makes your microservices not autonomous but also their performance is impacted if one of the services in the chain is impaired.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/Ba98HYkpvbZRfwP0E9wiyYfxvG82-2k034l2.jpeg\" alt=\"Synchronous \" /></p>\n<p>\\\nIt's considered an anti-pattern when a \"chain\" of HTTP requests is created between microservices while serving a client request. This causes the client response to be delayed and dependent on the performance of all microservices in the chain. A better implementation would be to use asynchronous communication using Messaging in which the client request is served right away.</p>\n<h3 id=\"asynchronous\">Asynchronous</h3>\n<p>In asynchronous message communication, the client or message sender usually doesn't wait for a response. It just sends the message to a message queue or message broker. This enforces a microservice's autonomy.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/Ba98HYkpvbZRfwP0E9wiyYfxvG82-fb134sz.jpeg\" alt=\"Asynchronous\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AMQP</strong>&nbsp;- The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol has been developed to provide a platform-agnostic method to ensure messages can be easily exchanged between services. Most of the major messaging systems have adopted this standard.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"numberofreceivers\">Number of Receivers</h3>\n<p>The second distinction between inter-service communication protocol types is if they are communicating to a single receiver or multiple.</p>\n<h4 id=\"singlereceivers\">Single Receivers</h4>\n<p>In a Single Receiver design each request must be processed by exactly one receiver or service. An example of this communication is the Command pattern.</p>\n<h4 id=\"multiplereceivers\">Multiple Receivers</h4>\n<p>In a Multiple Receiver design, each request can be processed by zero to multiple receivers. This type of communication must be asynchronous. An example is the publish/subscribe mechanism used in patterns like Event-driven architecture. This is based on an event-bus interface or message broker when propagating data updates between multiple microservices through events; it's usually implemented through a service bus or message broker by using topics and subscriptions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"combiningcommunicationmethods\">Combining Communication Methods</h3>\n<p>A microservice-based application will often use a combination of these communication methods. The most common type is single-receiver communication with a synchronous protocol like HTTP/HTTPS when invoking a regular Web API HTTP service. Microservices however, typically use messaging protocols for asynchronous communication between microservices.</p>\n<h3 id=\"eventdrivenmicroservicearchitecture\">Event-Driven Microservice Architecture</h3>\n<p>Events are records of something that has happened, a change in state. They are immutable (they cannot be changed or deleted), and they are ordered in the sequence of their creation.</p>\n<p>\\\nEvent-driven architecture refers to a system of loosely coupled microservices that exchange information between each other through the production and consumption of events. Interested systems can be notified of these state changes by subscribing to published events and then acting on the information using their business logic. This is referred to as the Pub Sub Pattern.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The main benefits of event-driven systems are&nbsp;asynchronous&nbsp;behavior and&nbsp;loosely coupled&nbsp;structures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\\\nBenefits of the Event-Driven Microservice Architecture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Loosely coupled structure</li>\n<li>Asynchronous event-driven functionality</li>\n<li>Isolation of the microservices</li>\n<li>No synchronous REST calls</li>\n<li>Performance</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"eventsanddomaindrivendesign\">Events and Domain-Driven Design</h3>\n<p>In the Domain-driven design (DDD) approach to software development, the business domain is carefully modeled in software and evolved over time, independently of the infrastructure that makes the system work. DDD is used to define the different bounded contexts that represent the various business processes that the application needs to perform.</p>\n<p>\\\nThese contexts are then joined together with events, creating a unidirectional dependency graph that decouples each bounded context from those that arise downstream, to create rich event-streaming business applications.</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"messagingsystems\">Messaging Systems</h2>\n<p><strong>Enterprise Application Integration (EAI)</strong>&nbsp;is the implementation of technologies that facilitate communication between enterprise applications and microservices. EAI establishes a middleware framework that helps data flow freely between services without significant changes to the applications themselves.</p>\n<p>\\\n<strong>Enterprise Messaging Systems (EMS)</strong>&nbsp;are the Middleware that facilitates the exchange of messages between microservices. Referred to as&nbsp;<strong>Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM)</strong>, it's the infrastructure supporting sending and receiving messages between distributed services.</p>\n<h3 id=\"messagingarchitectures\">Messaging Architectures</h3>\n<p>EAI architecture is made up of the following components.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Producer</strong>&nbsp;- Entity which creates the event (also known as the&nbsp;<strong>Publisher</strong>).</li>\n<li><strong>Consumer</strong>&nbsp;- Entity which consumes the event (also known as the&nbsp;<strong>Subscriber</strong>).</li>\n<li><strong>Topic</strong>&nbsp;- Category name to which messages are published and stored.</li>\n<li><strong>Endpoint</strong>&nbsp;- The network point at which consuming entity is connected to the MOM.</li>\n<li><strong>Broker</strong>&nbsp;- Single central controller which contains the MOM logic.</li>\n<li><strong>Bus</strong>&nbsp;- Architecture where the endpoints contain the logic rather than a single entity.</li>\n<li><strong>Routing</strong>&nbsp;- Sending the message to the interested parties.</li>\n<li><strong>Transformation</strong>&nbsp;- Modifying the message so that it can be understood by a subscriber.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"messagebrokervsmessagebus\">Message Broker vs Message Bus</h3>\n<p>Messaging systems have two primary architecture designs, Message Broker and Message Bus. The Message Bus architecture is an advanced way of implementing EAI.</p>\n<h3 id=\"messagebrokerarchitecture\">Message Broker Architecture</h3>\n<p>The first inter-service communications solutions incorporated all the functionality required for integration into a central hub called the \"broker\". A key point in this model is the&nbsp;<strong><em>broker contains the logic</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>\\\nIn a broker approach, a central piece of software (the \"message broker\") resides in the middle of the network, and provides all message transformation, routing, and any other inter-application functionality. All communication between applications must flow through the hub, allowing the hub to maintain data concurrency for the entire network. It's referred to as a&nbsp;<strong>hub-and-spoke</strong>&nbsp;architecture.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/Ba98HYkpvbZRfwP0E9wiyYfxvG82-n32341p.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h2 id=\"brokeradvantages\">Broker Advantages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Direct Communication</strong>&nbsp;- creates a direct information pipeline between the event generator and the interested parties. Communications involve only the sender, broker, and the designated receivers. As a state change occurs, those parties can almost immediately know that it happened.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Complex functions</strong>&nbsp;- can be achieved with chained Event Brokers. For example, by using a log-based Event Broker, events can be \"replayed\" as part of a historical log.</p>\n<p>\\</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Broker Disadvantages</p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No Single Source of Truth&nbsp;- Because the logic is part of the broker, the endpoints do not have a way to resolve conflicting events.</li>\n<li>Scaling&nbsp;- Does not scale well for complex functions.</li>\n<li>Reliability&nbsp;- The broker can become a single point of failure for the network because it's responsible for all concurrency between the application's data sets and states, all messages between applicants must pass through it. Under heavy load, the broker can become a bottleneck for messages. A single central destination for all messages also makes it difficult to use the broker model successfully across large geographical distances.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"messagebusarchitecture\">Message Bus Architecture</h3>\n<p>Bus architecture represents an evolution of the broker hub-and-spoke model. It uses a defined set of standards to govern the flow of data between applications and implies a common protocol spoken and understood by all participants.</p>\n<p>\\\nA Message Bus architecture is where the&nbsp;<strong><em>endpoints contain the logic</em></strong>&nbsp;instead of the Broker (or Bus in this case). The Apps use a shared (common) set of interfaces and are responsible for preparing the message, so it complies with the type of messages the rest of the apps connected to the bus expect.</p>\n<p>\\\n <img src=\"https://cdn.hackernoon.com/images/Ba98HYkpvbZRfwP0E9wiyYfxvG82-kw334us.jpeg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>\\</p>\n<h3 id=\"enterpriseservicebus\">Enterprise Service Bus</h3>\n<p>The term Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) refers to a communication bus between different applications. Each application is enabled to talk to the bus, which in turn allows the sharing of data and communications between the connected applications.</p>\n<p>:::tip\n<strong>Tip</strong>: The terms Broker and Bus are often used interchangeably and there are many interpretations.</p>\n<p>:::</p>\n<h4 id=\"busadvantages\">Bus Advantages</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Allows more ubiquitous access to events and data.</li>\n<li>Producers and consumers don’t need to have knowledge of one another.</li>\n<li>New services can start consuming messages immediately without producer changes.</li>\n<li>Service discovery is easily achieved by sending messages to the right topics.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\\\nThanks &amp; Happy Reading!</p>\n<p>\\</p>",

      "content": "The Verge is applauding Hyundai's electric SUV, the IONIQ 5 for \"Fake shifting, real fun.\" And others agree. \"The Ioniq 5 N is also special for how it simulates the 'feel' of gear shifting,\" writes the blog Inside EVs, \"including the jolt and brief interruption in power that happens and the mechanical resistance that's normal upon downshifting. \n\n\"The Ioniq 5 N also simulates engine sounds through the speakers, will let you rev the 'engine' while parked and has a 'redline' you'll hit before you need to shift again. It's all great fun.\"\n\n[E]very single person who drives the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N, whether they're a die-hard EV person or the most hardcore electro-skeptic, absolutely loves it. And they love the fake shifting most of all... Shut up and embrace the fake EV shifting, you nerds. Find some joy in your life for once. \n\nAnd joy will definitely be on order with the new 2025 Kia EV6 GT. The U.S.-spec version of Kia's updated crossover made its debut [November 21] at the L.A. Auto Show. And while there's still a lot we don't know about it, we have power specs and one key detail: the EV6 GT now gets a simulated gear shift feature. \"The GT's new Virtual Gear Shift feature enhances driving immersion by simulating gear shifts with visuals, engine sound effects, and a tactile sensation through motor torque adjustments,\" Kia officials said in a news release. \n\n\nThe Verge points out that Hyundai's Ioniq 5 N even uses speakers &mdash; both inside the car and outside &mdash; to broadcast the sounds of ignition, a boosted EV sound, and a third sound which \"sounds like a robotic version of a fighter jet.\"\nPaired with the seemingly endless power and torque offered by the electric motors, I couldn't stop grinning. It's just like a little kid making car noises as they push a Hot Wheels car around a track, but combined with the driving experience in the Ioniq 5 N, it just taps into a pure enthusiast joy. Even kids around my neighborhood stopped and looked when I started the Ioniq 5 N up with the sound management turned on. They'd pull out their phones to take photos and videos as I drove off, happily faking the internal combustion engine experience and knowing I wasn't adding a drop of carbon to the atmosphere. \n\nThe Ioniq 5 N just might be the performance EV that will change self-described \"auto enthusiast\" minds about the electric transition. It's that good.\n<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Do+Electric+Cars+Offer+'Fake+Shifting%2C+Real+Fun'%3F%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F04%2F0527208%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F04%2F0527208%2Fdo-electric-cars-offer-fake-shifting-real-fun%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/12/04/0527208/do-electric-cars-offer-fake-shifting-real-fun?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=23540979&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe>",

It could create playable games based on a single text input. \n\nElevenLabs announced a new Conversational AI system. It's a voice bot meant to feel like you're making a phone call. Tom's Guide AI editor Ryan Morrison used it to clone his voice to act as technical support for his dad. \n\nOpenAI will probably announce an upgraded Sora video model in the coming days, but we were impressed by the new Hunyuan Video model that released a demo this week.
