But what if you want to tweak these LLMs do to what you want? Instead of being stuck with the tools that a vendor gives you, the goal of Continue.dev is to allow you to customise this yourself. In this podcast we talk to Ty Dunn, co-founder of the project to learn more about this.\n\nIf you are curious to learn more about this effort, please check out https://continue.dev.
