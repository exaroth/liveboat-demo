And even arguments like \"feeding proprietary code\" will be eventually solved by companies hosting their own isolated LLMs as they become better and hardware becomes more available.<p>My prediction is that junior to mid level software engineering will disappear mostly, while senior engineers will transition to be more of a guiding hand to LLMs output, until eventually LLMs will become so good, that senior people won't be needed any more.<p>So, fellow software engineers, how do you future-proof your career in light of, the inevitable, LLM take over?<p>--- EDIT ---<p>I want to clarify something, because there seems to be slight misunderstanding.<p>A lot of people have been talking about SWE being not only about code, and I agree with that. But it's also easier to sell this idea to a young person who is just starting in this career. And while I want this Ask HN to be helpful to young/fresh engineers as well, I'm more interested in getting help for myself, and many others who are in a similar position.<p>I have almost two decades of SWE experience. But despite that, I seem to have missed the party where they told us that \"coding is not a means to an end\", and realized it in the past few years. I bet there are people out there who are in a similar situations.
