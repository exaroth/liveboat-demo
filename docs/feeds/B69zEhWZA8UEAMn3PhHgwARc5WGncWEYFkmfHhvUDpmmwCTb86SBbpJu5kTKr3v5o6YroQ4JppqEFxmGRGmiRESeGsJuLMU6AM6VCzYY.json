Learn more at https://kubecon.io\n\nSecuring Outgoing Traffic: Building a Powerful Internet Egress Gateway for Reliable Connectivity - Edie Yang & Akshita Agarwal, Airbnb\n\nConcerned about secure and reliable outgoing traffic from your organization's mesh network? With the increasing demand to use external vendor apis for LLMs, along with vulnerabilities like Log4j, the need for preventing data exfiltration and maintaining strong safeguards is critical. But managing access to multiple external domains within the service mesh can be daunting. Discover the secrets behind building a powerful Internet Egress gateway using Istio and Envoy. This enlightening talk unveils a way to define fine-grained access policy to monitor and audit outgoing traffic from your mesh network. Besides, it demonstrates how to build a generic multi-tenant gateway that can be used across heterogeneous services and save years of repeated engineering work. By the end of the talk, attendees will gain an understanding of what an Internet Egress Gateway is, why it is necessary, and how they can configure it for their own services using the open-source Istio/Envoy based solution.",

Learn more at https://kubecon.io\n\nObject, Block, or File Storage? Choosing the Right Cloud Storage to Integrate Into Kubernetes - Mitch Becker & Tom McDonald, Amazon Web Services (AWS)\n\nThis presentation helps simplify the container storage landscape to assist K8s users make educated cloud storage choices based on their workload requirements and data strategy. You already know K8s is a an open-source platform that orchestrates containerized applications. But what type of cloud storage should one deploy for stateless and stateful applications to ensure persistent data across various operational scenarios? Different storage types cater to specific use cases within K8s environments. Organizations often require persistent storage to run K8s for stateful use cases such as Large-Scale Application Deployment, High-Performance Computing (HPC), AI/ML, Microservices Management, CI/CD Pipelines, and Big Data Processing. Because Block, File, and Object Storage are used in varying ways for containerized workloads, this talk will explain use cases for each storage type and educate the attendees so their selection of storage supports their applications and overall data strategy.",
