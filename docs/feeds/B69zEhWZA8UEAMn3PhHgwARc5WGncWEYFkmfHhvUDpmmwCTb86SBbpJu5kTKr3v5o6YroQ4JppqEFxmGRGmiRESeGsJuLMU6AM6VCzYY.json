Choosing the Right Cloud Storage to Integrate Into Kubernetes - Mitch Becker & Tom McDonald, Amazon Web Services (AWS)\n\nThis presentation helps simplify the container storage landscape to assist K8s users make educated cloud storage choices based on their workload requirements and data strategy. You already know K8s is a an open-source platform that orchestrates containerized applications. But what type of cloud storage should one deploy for stateless and stateful applications to ensure persistent data across various operational scenarios? Different storage types cater to specific use cases within K8s environments. Organizations often require persistent storage to run K8s for stateful use cases such as Large-Scale Application Deployment, High-Performance Computing (HPC), AI/ML, Microservices Management, CI/CD Pipelines, and Big Data Processing. Because Block, File, and Object Storage are used in varying ways for containerized workloads, this talk will explain use cases for each storage type and educate the attendees so their selection of storage supports their applications and overall data strategy.",

Without it, nodes aren’t ready, and pods aren’t scheduled. This session will provide a brief overview of what the CNI is, where it intersects with Kubernetes, the latest updates, how you can get involved and the future of the CNI. We have talked a lot about CNI 2.0 and now it is becoming a reality. This will be the biggest change to the CNI however let's not get carried away, we will make this seamless for you! Attendees will leave with an understanding of what the CNI is and how it fits into the larger picture of Kubernetes networking so that you can contribute to the CNI community!",

That is not surprising. While there are lots of deaf engineers, until recently, most conferences — and virtually any other community activity — haven't been accessible to deaf community members. But for KubeCon, that all changed exactly a year ago! During this discussion, deaf panelists from various countries will shed light on their unique experiences being deaf in tech and the impact that making KubeCon accessible has had on their lives and hopes for the future. Attendees will learn why the technology space is a great fit for deaf individuals, the benefits and opportunities deaf professionals bring to the table, and what it takes to be an accessible and welcoming community. Panelists will also debunk common misconceptions and empower *you* to take steps toward a more inclusive cloud native ecosystem.",

Yet, many organizations and engineers struggle to understand or realize this kind of value from contributing to these projects. In this talk, Bob and Mario will discuss the many benefits individuals and companies can achieve by contributing to open source and guide you through the first steps to becoming a contributor. They will also cover how to develop a lightweight open source strategy and convince your organization that an open source first approach can yield great returns.",

Many factors impact the cost of running AI/ML workloads such as GPU utilization, GPU VM size, idle time, etc. These costs are often ignored and considered inherent in running GPU workloads. But if running workloads at scale and left unoptimized, costs will quickly spin out of control. In this talk, we leverage NVIDIA DCGM exporter with Prometheus for GPU metrics monitoring alongside OpenCost to measure the Kubernetes spend of our GPU workloads. We will provide an overview of OpenCost, highlighting its role in bridging the gap between the developer and platform teams through visibility and accountability of spend. We will demonstrate how to use the NVIDIA GPU Operator and how techniques such as partitioning can lead to significant cost savings.",

However, the inference process for these models presents significant challenges. LLMs are computationally intensive, often requiring specialized hardware like TPUs or GPUs to achieve reasonable response times. In some cases their substantial size can strain the resources of a single machine. Specifically, models such as Gemini, Claude, and GPT4 are too large to fit on any single GPU or TPU device, let alone on any single multi-accelerator machine, necessitating what we refer to as multi-node server deployment where a single model server “backend” runs as a distributed process on multiple nodes to harness enough accelerator memory to fit and run the model. This talk presents LeaderWorkerSet, a new k8s API that enables multi-node model inference. We demonstrate its capabilities by orchestrating state of the art model servers such as vLLM and JetStream on both GPUs and TPUs.",
