The main advantage is that it enables patching without the need to rebuild the entire container image, offering a faster and more efficient approach to securing containers.

So when ARM instances became commonly available on one of our providers, seemingly providing great performance at a lower cost, we had to take a closer look! In this talk, we will first describe the steps we took to make our clusters ARM-ready and a few interesting issues we encountered during our initial tests: from performance regressions due to compiler behaviors to subtle memory corruption bugs. We will then discuss new challenges, in particular how to achieve load-balancing and auto-scaling when running workloads on a mix of CPUs with different performances, and share our results. If migrating real workloads to ARM proved challenging, it was worth the effort and we now run more than 50% of our workloads on ARM.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/hD5lXEgp9Tg?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"KubeCon + CloudNativeCon is coming to London in April 2025","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h4D7-RM848","date":1733858257,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Don't miss out!
