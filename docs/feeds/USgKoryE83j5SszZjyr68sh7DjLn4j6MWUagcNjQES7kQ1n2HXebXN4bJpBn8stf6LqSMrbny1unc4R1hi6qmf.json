I&#39;m developing an internal framework for my company about handling errors, around the concept of using namespace error codes.</p> <p>For example, use DEPS.PG.NOT_FOUND for database error, when this error is handled by the profile/user layer, it&#39;s wrapped as PRFL.USR.NOT_FOUND.</p> <p>It may be a bit over-engineering, but now the error codes become more structured. The logs become more manageable and clearer, with the ability to tag and monitor each code, separating between expected and unexpected code. I&#39;m sharing the idea in this article. Would love to hear your thoughts, or know more about how you handle errors in your projects.</p> <p><a href=\"https://olivernguyen.io/w/namespace.error\">https://olivernguyen.io/w/namespace.error</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/olvrng\"> /u/olvrng </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1h7x5ks/handing_errors_with_namespace_codes/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1h7x5ks/handing_errors_with_namespace_codes/\">[comments]</a></span>",

However I still actually want these to complete when the shutdown occurs, <em>before then shutting down</em>. Do I just create a new context here for the database that is not wrapped in the signal cancel?<br/> - If ctx.Done() is hit, then I suppose I want to do a `range` on any remaining entries before the other service closes the channel?</p> <p>I sense I am doing something wrong here as I have not been able to find a solution!

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone!!</p> <p>This is my 5th post in this Subreddit on my journey to build a high-performance scalable image compression service (or the whole project now). </p> <p>After launching <a href=\"https://gofilecompress.com/\">gofilecompress.com</a>, where you can compress single PNG files (up to 5MB), I am starting to work on a much bigger project related to it: a <strong>batch image compression service</strong> that handles <strong>massive ZIP files (1–10GB+)</strong> asynchronously. The idea is that users or organizations upload their files, and the service processes them in the background. After a few minutes or hours (depending on size), they’ll get an email notification with a link to download the compressed results.</p> <p>This time, I’m aiming to build something <strong>high-performant and scalable</strong>, designed for multiple users and large-scale tasks. Here’s what I’ve got so far:</p> <h1>Architecture Overview</h1> <p>(you can view the architecture flow chart for better understanding of it visually <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U51iAi9XUPZFd7yxvq3CFnXHrWIG8zOx/view?usp=share_link\">Architecture Flow Chart</a>)</p> <p>The system is built on a <strong>microservices-based, event-driven architecture</strong>, where everything is containerized and deployed using <strong>AWS ECS</strong> for easy scaling. Here’s the key flow:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Microservices:</strong> Each major task (uploading, compression, notifications) is handled by a separate service to keep things modular and manageable.</li> <li><strong>Event-Driven Workflow:</strong> Jobs are queued and processed asynchronously using <strong>AWS SQS</strong>, which helps handle multiple user requests efficiently.</li> <li><strong>Components:</strong> File storage is managed with <strong>S3</strong>, job metadata is tracked in <strong>RDS</strong>, and the API is exposed via <strong>API Gateway</strong>.</li> </ol> <p>Also, if someone remembers my previous posts, you can notice that <strong>I have switched to AWS from GCP</strong>. The reason for that is aside from building an actual scalable product, but I also want to learn tools and skills that will allow me to consider many job opportunities as a young student who wants to become a great backend engineer. </p> <h1>How It Works</h1> <ol> <li><strong>Create a Compression Request/Job by User:</strong> <ul> <li>Users start by calling the <strong>API Gateway (the single point to reach my VPC)</strong> to create a compression job.</li> <li>The <strong>Upload Service</strong> stores the job in <strong>RDS</strong> (Amazon&#39;s SQL Service) with a status of &quot;INITIATED&quot; and returns <strong>pre-signed S3 URLs</strong> for uploading the ZIP file.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Upload the File:</strong> <ul> <li>Users upload their ZIP files in chunks (up to 5MB each) from Frontend directly to <strong>S3</strong> using the pre-signed URLs.</li> <li>Once the upload is done, <strong>S3</strong> triggers a notification, and the <strong>Upload Service</strong> updates the job status to &quot;UPLOADED&quot; in <strong>RDS</strong>. The job is then pushed to <strong>SQS</strong> for processing.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Compression Time:</strong> <ul> <li>The <strong>Compression Service</strong> picks up jobs from <strong>SQS</strong>, streams the ZIP file from <strong>S3</strong>, and processes each image in memory.</li> <li>Compressed images are added to a new ZIP file, which is then uploaded back to <strong>S3</strong>.</li> <li>The service updates the progress and marks the job as &quot;COMPLETED&quot; in <strong>RDS</strong>.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Notification and Download:</strong> <ul> <li>Once the job is done, the <strong>Notification Service</strong> sends an email to the user with a download link (a pre-signed URL for the compressed ZIP file stored in <strong>S3</strong>).</li> </ul></li> </ol> <h1>Why I Designed It This Way</h1> <p>I wanted to keep things modular, scalable, and easy to deploy, which is why I went with <strong>microservices and containers</strong> on <strong>AWS ECS</strong>. Using <strong>SQS</strong> for task queuing keeps everything asynchronous and smooth, even when there are multiple user requests. Storing files directly in <strong>S3</strong> ensures I don’t run into storage issues, and tracking progress in <strong>RDS</strong> makes it easier to debug and monitor.</p> <p>So, that&#39;s it! :) I would love to hear your thoughts on this project and any recommendations or best practices you think I should consider or add.</p> <p>To be honest, I also have a question: as I start managing this big project, do you have any suggestions for staying organized and ensuring everything is well-structured? I&#39;m using <strong>Notion</strong> right now to track tasks, but I&#39;m also considering tools like <strong>JIRA</strong> for a more detailed project management workflow. </p> <p>Thanks for checking this out! I’m super open to feedback as I fine-tune this!!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Investorator3000\"> /u/Investorator3000 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1h8e6p7/highperformance_image_compression_project_part_5/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1h8e6p7/highperformance_image_compression_project_part_5/\">[comments]</a></span>",
