Apart from the latter, the rest of them, including Linux kernel 6.12, will be officially supported until the end of December 2026. Hopefully, Linux kernel 6.12 will be supported for more than two years as the kernel maintainers usually aim for four years of support for a new LTS kernel, especially if there's demand from hardware manufacturers and other companies that aim to use a long-term supported kernel in their devices.\n<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Linux+Kernel+6.12+Confirmed+As+LTS%2C+Will+Be+Supported+For+'Multiple+Years'%3A+https%3A%2F%2Flinux.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F09%2F0125219%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flinux.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F09%2F0125219%2Flinux-kernel-612-confirmed-as-lts-will-be-supported-for-multiple-years%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/24/12/09/0125219/linux-kernel-612-confirmed-as-lts-will-be-supported-for-multiple-years?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Linux 4.19, the Last Supported Kernel of the Linux 4.x Series, Finally Reaches EOL","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/24/12/07/2047211/linux-419-the-last-supported-kernel-of-the-linux-4x-series-finally-reaches-eol?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1733604600,"author":"EditorDavid","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Slashdot reader prisoninmate shared this report from 9to5Linux:\nLinux kernel 4.19, the last of the Linux 4.x kernel series, has now reached the end of its supported life as announced earlier on the Linux kernel mailing list by kernel developer Greg Kroah-Hartman. The Linux 4.19 kernel branch was released more than six years ago, on October 22nd, 2018, and it received no less than 325 maintenance updates, the last one being Linux 4.19.325. The biggest highlights of Linux kernel 4.19 were initial Wi-Fi 6 support, the EROFS file system, and a union mount filesystem implementation. Kroah-Hartman said on the mailing list. \"This one is finished, it is end-of-life as of right now... It had a good life...\"\n\n\nAs a \"fun\" proof that this one is finished (and that any company saying they care about it really should have their statements validated with facts), I looked at the \"unfixed\" CVEs from this kernel release. Currently it is a list 983 CVEs long, too long to list here.... Note, this does NOT count the hardware CVEs which kernel.org does not track, and many are sill unfixed in this kernel branch. \n\nYes, CVE counts don't mean much these days, but hey, it's a signal of something, right? I take it to mean that no one is caring enough to backport the needed fixes to this branch, which means that you shouldn't be using it anymore. \n\nAnyway, please move off to a more modern kernel if you were using this one for some reason.

By infecting the firmware that runs immediately before the operating system loads, these UEFI bootkits continue to run even when the hard drive is replaced or reformatted. Now the same type of chip-dwelling malware has been found in the wild for backdooring Linux machines. Researchers at security firm ESET said Wednesday that Bootkitty -- the name unknown threat actors gave to their Linux bootkit -- was uploaded to VirusTotal earlier this month. Compared to its Windows cousins, Bootkitty is still relatively rudimentary, containing imperfections in key under-the-hood functionality and lacking the means to infect all Linux distributions other than Ubuntu. That has led the company researchers to suspect the new bootkit is likely a proof-of-concept release. To date, ESET has found no evidence of actual infections in the wild.\n \nStill, Bootkitty suggests threat actors may be actively developing a Linux version of the same sort of unkillable bootkit that previously was found only targeting Windows machines. \"Whether a proof of concept or not, Bootkitty marks an interesting move forward in the UEFI threat landscape, breaking the belief about modern UEFI bootkits being Windows-exclusive threats,\" ESET researchers wrote. \"Even though the current version from VirusTotal does not, at the moment, represent a real threat to the majority of Linux systems, it emphasizes the necessity of being prepared for potential future threats.\" [...] As ESET notes, the discovery is nonetheless significant because it demonstrates someone -- most likely a malicious threat actor -- is pouring resources and considerable know-how into creating working UEFI bootkits for Linux. Currently, there are few simple ways for people to check the integrity of the UEFI running on either Windows or Linux devices. The demand for these sorts of defenses will likely grow in the coming years.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=The+World's+First+Unkillable+UEFI+Bootkit+For+Linux%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fit.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F11%2F27%2F2028231%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fit.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F11%2F27%2F2028231%2Fthe-worlds-first-unkillable-uefi-bootkit-for-linux%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://it.slashdot.org/story/24/11/27/2028231/the-worlds-first-unkillable-uefi-bootkit-for-linux?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"SUSE Unveils Major Rebranding, New Data-Protecting AI Platform","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/24/11/25/2112247/suse-unveils-major-rebranding-new-data-protecting-ai-platform?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1732569900,"author":"BeauHD","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"An anonymous reader quotes a report from ZDNet, written by Steven Vaughan-Nichols: At KubeCon North America, SUSE announced a significant rebranding effort, several new product offerings, and the launch of SUSE AI, a secure platform for deploying and running generative AI (gen AI) applications. SUSE has renamed its entire portfolio to make product names more descriptive and customer-friendly. Notable changes include:\n - Rancher, SUSE's Kubernetes offering, is now SUSE Rancher. - Liberty Linux, the company's Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)/CentOS clone and support offering, becomes SUSE Multi Linux Support. - Harvester is rebranded as SUSE Virtualization - Longhorn is now SUSE Storage.\n \n[...] Also, like everyone else, SUSE now has an AI offering: SUSE AI. This isn't an AI chatbot, like Red Hat's Lightspeed AI tool. No, it's a secure platform for deploying and running gen AI applications. This new offering addresses key challenges faced by enterprises as they move from AI experimentation to deployment, particularly in areas of security and compliance. These are SUSE AI's top features, as highlighted by Vaughan-Nichols: \n1. Security by Design: SUSE AI provides security and certifications at the software infrastructure level, along with zero-trust security tools, templates, and compliance playbooks.\n\n2. Multifaceted Trust: The platform ensures that generated data is correct and private customer and IP data remain secure. It supports deployment across various environments, including on-premise, hybrid, cloud, and air-gapped setups.\n\n3. Choice and Flexibility: SUSE AI allows customers to select and deploy their preferred AI components and LLMs.\n\n4.

After formalizing an updated enforcement process for unacceptable behaviors, it then recommended that during the Linux 6.13 kernel development cycle, Overstreet's participation should be restricted (with his pull requests declined). Phoronix covered their ruling, and ItsFOSS and The Register offer some of the backstory. \n\nOverstreet had already acknowledged that \"Things really went off the rails (and I lost my cool, and earned the ire of the CoC committee)\" in a 6,200-word blog post on his Patreon page. But he also emphasized that \"I'm going to keep writing code no matter what. Things may turn into more of a hassle to actually get the code, but people who want to keep running bcachefs will always be able to (that's the beauty of open source, we can always fork), and I will keep supporting my users...\" \n\nMore excerpts from Overstreet's blog post:\n\nI got an emails from multiple people, including from Linus, to the effect of \"trust me, you don't want to be known as an asshole &mdash; you should probably send him an apology\"... Linus is a genuinely good guy: I know a lot of people reading this will have also seen our pull request arguments, so I specifically wanted to say that here: I think he and I do get under each other's skin, but those arguments are the kind of arguments you get between people who care deeply about their work and simply have different perspectives on the situation... \n\n\n[M]y response was to say \"no\" to a public apology, for a variety of reasons: because this was the result of an ongoing situation that had now impacted two different teams and projects, and I think that issue needs attention &mdash; and I think there's broader issues at stake here, regarding the CoC board. But mostly, because that kind of thing feels like it ought to be kept personal... I'd like a better process that isn't so heavy handed for dealing with situations where tensions rise and communications break down. As for that process: just talk to people... [W]e're a community. We're not interchangeable cogs to be kicked out and replaced when someone is \"causing a problem\", we should be watching out for each other... \n\nAnother note that I was raising with the CoC is that a culture of dismissiveness, of finding ways to avoid the technical discussions we're supposed to be having, really is toxic, and moreso than mere flamewars... we really do need to be engaging properly with each other in order to do our work well. \n\nAfter the official response from the committee, Overstreet responded on the kernel mailing list. \"I do want to apologize for things getting this heated the other day, but I need to also tell you why I reacted the way I did... I do take correctness issues very seriously, and I will get frosty or genuinely angry if they're being ignored or brushed aside.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Flamewar+Leads+to+Declining+of+Bcachefs+Pull+Requests+During+Linux+6.13+Kernel+Development+Cycle%3A+https%3A%2F%2Flinux.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F11%2F25%2F0427242%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flinux.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F11%2F25%2F0427242%2Fflamewar-leads-to-declining-of-bcachefs-pull-requests-during-linux-613-kernel-development-cycle%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/24/11/25/0427242/flamewar-leads-to-declining-of-bcachefs-pull-requests-during-linux-613-kernel-development-cycle?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Red Hat is Becoming an Official Microsoft 'Windows Subsystem for Linux' Distro","url":"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/11/23/0251245/red-hat-is-becoming-an-official-microsoft-windows-subsystem-for-linux-distro?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1732383240,"author":"EditorDavid","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"\"You can use any Linux distribution inside of the Windows Subsystem for Linux\" Microsoft recently reminded Windows users, \"even if it is not available in the Microsoft Store, by importing it with a tar file.\" \n\nBut being an official distro \"makes it easier for Windows Subsystem for Linux users to install and discover it with actions like wsl --list --online and wsl --install,\" Microsoft pointed out this week.

Red Hat is committed to driving greater choice and flexibility for developers, which is why we're working closely with the Microsoft team to bring Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the largest commercially available open source Linux distribution, to all WSL users.\" \nRead Pacheco's own blog post here. \n\nBut in addition Microsoft is also releasing \"a new way to make WSL distros,\" they announced this week, \"with a new architecture that backs how WSL distros are packaged and installed.\"\n\nUp until now, you could make a WSL distro by either creating an appx package and distributing it via the Microsoft Store, or by importing a .tar file with wsl -import. We wanted to improve this by making it possible to create a WSL distro without needing to write Windows code, and for users to more easily install their distros from a file or network share which is common in enterprise scenarios... With the tar based architecture, you can start with the same .tar file (which can be an exported Linux container!) and just edit it to add details to make it a WSL distro... These options will describe key distro attributes, like the name of the distro, its icon in Windows, and its out of box experience (OOBE) which is what happens when you run WSL for the first time. You'll notice that the oobe_command option points to a file which is a Linux executable, meaning you can set up your full experience just in Linux if you wish.\n<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Red+Hat+is+Becoming+an+Official+Microsoft+'Windows+Subsystem+for+Linux'+Distro%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F11%2F23%2F0251245%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F11%2F23%2F0251245%2Fred-hat-is-becoming-an-official-microsoft-windows-subsystem-for-linux-distro%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/11/23/0251245/red-hat-is-becoming-an-official-microsoft-windows-subsystem-for-linux-distro?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Jim Zemlin, 'Head Janitor of Open Source,' Marks 20 Years At Linux Foundation","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/24/11/21/2022220/jim-zemlin-head-janitor-of-open-source-marks-20-years-at-linux-foundation?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1732226400,"author":"BeauHD","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"ZDNet's Steven Vaughan-Nichols interviews Jim Zemlin, Executive Director of The Linux Foundation and \"head janitor of open source.\" An anonymous Slashdot reader shares an excerpt from the article: When I first met Zemlin, he was the head of the Free Standards Group (FSG). The FSG's main project was the Linux Standard Base (LSB) project. The LSB's goal was to get everyone in the Linux desktop world to agree on standards to ensure compatibility among distributions and their applications. Oh well, some struggles are never-ending. Another group, the Open Source Development Labs (OSDL), was simultaneously working on standardizing enterprise Linux. The two non-profits had the same goal of making Linux more useful and popular, so they agreed to merge. Zemlin was the natural pick to head this new group, which would be called The Linux Foundation.\n \nAt the time, he told me: \"The combination of the two groups really enables the Linux platform and all the members of the Linux Foundation to work really effectively. I clearly understand what the organization's charter needs to be: We need to provide services that are useful to the community and industry, as well as protect, promote, and continue to standardize the platform.\" While initially focused on Linux, the Foundation's scope expanded significantly around 2010. Until then, the organization had hosted about a dozen projects related to the Linux operating system. However, as Linux gained dominance in various sectors, including high-performance computing, automotive, embedded systems, mobile devices, and cloud computing, the Linux Foundation started to broaden its horizons. Zemlin says there are three words that sum up the Linux Foundation's effort to keep open source safe and open to a new generation of developers: helpful, hopeful, and humble.\n \n\"You must be genuinely helpful to developers. We're the janitors of open source. The Linux Foundation takes care of all the boring but important stuff necessary to support software development so developers can focus on code. This work includes events, project marketing, project infrastructure, finances for projects, training and education, legal assistance, standards, facilitation, open source evangelism, and much, much more.\"\n \nHe continued: \"The hopeful part is really the optimistic part. When in 2007, people were saying that this would never work. When leaders of huge companies tell everyone that you know all that you're doing is a cancer or terrible, you have to have a sense of optimism that there are better days ahead. You have to always be thinking, 'No, we can do it and stick with it.'\"\n \nHowever, Zemlin concluded that the number one trait that's \"important in working in open source is this idea of humility. I work with hundreds of people every day, and none of them work at the Linux Foundation. We must lead through influence, and that really has been the secret for 20 years of working here without going totally insane. If you can check your ego and take criticism, open source actually turns out to be a really fun community to work with.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Jim+Zemlin%2C+'Head+Janitor+of+Open+Source%2C'+Marks+20+Years+At+Linux+Foundation%3A+https%3A%2F%2Flinux.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F11%2F21%2F2022220%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Flinux.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F11%2F21%2F2022220%2Fjim-zemlin-head-janitor-of-open-source-marks-20-years-at-linux-foundation%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/24/11/21/2022220/jim-zemlin-head-janitor-of-open-source-marks-20-years-at-linux-foundation?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""}]}
