When I studied for other certifications, I used to create notebooks so comprehensive I could just read through them and know everything I needed to pass—practical, exam-focused, and memorable. They didn’t cover every edge case but were complete enough to function as a one-stop resource. For example, my Terraform Associate notes were around 7,000 words, and I imagine a comparable CKA would be 2× in length at least.</p> <p>For CKA, I haven’t found anything similar yet. Most resources either too high level, or are so dense it’s hard to distinguish what’s important for the exam. I’m looking for something that explains key concepts, includes practical examples, and covers what’s essential to know—without being overwhelming.</p> <p>If anyone has come across a resource or notes like this, I’d love to hear about your favorite ones.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NtzsnS32\"> /u/NtzsnS32 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1heqqmq/favorite_cka_notes/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1heqqmq/favorite_cka_notes/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"FlowSchema examples needed","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1herw9j/flowschema_examples_needed/","date":1734266858,"author":"/u/pachirulis","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Any good examples of ratelimiting (rejecting abusers) service accounts with FlowSchema?
