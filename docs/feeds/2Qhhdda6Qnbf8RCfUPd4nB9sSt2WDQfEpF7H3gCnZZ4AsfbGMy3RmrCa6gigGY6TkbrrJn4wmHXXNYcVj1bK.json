Then the code ran ~50% slower! I tried with i8, i16, u16 all with about the same performance as using u8. Changing to u32 didn&#39;t make a difference compared to i32, and using u64/i64 made it 73% slower.</p> <p>I don&#39;t know the x86_64 instructions, but I&#39;ve assumed the cost of widening the types would be free on a superscalar architecture even if it needed special instructions to do so. What else could cause the slowdown? Worse hashing performance?</p> <p>---- Edit after comments:</p> <p>The code is here: <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/y0xVWHfs\">https://pastebin.com/y0xVWHfs</a></p> <p>It uses these crates:<br/> aoc-runner = &quot;0.3.0&quot;<br/> aoc-runner-derive = &quot;0.3.0&quot;</p> <p>but one could just include the input file and add a main that calls input_generator with it, followed by calling solve_part2 with the result from input_generator.</p> <p>I&#39;ve benchmarked it with cargo-aoc bench, it compiles the code in release mode when benchmarking. It only benchmarks the solve_part2 function, not the input_generator call.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ClimberSeb\"> /u/ClimberSeb </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1h7wqx6/why_is_u32i32_faster_than_u8/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1h7wqx6/why_is_u32i32_faster_than_u8/\">[comments]</a></span>",
