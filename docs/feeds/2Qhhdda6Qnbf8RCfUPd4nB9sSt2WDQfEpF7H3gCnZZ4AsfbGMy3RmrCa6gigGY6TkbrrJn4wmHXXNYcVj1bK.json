I am a JavaScript dev mostly working on full stack web3 projects. So, how would you go about learning rust of you started today. Looking for some practical advice. Personally, I learn better by building something. So that&#39;s the kind of approach that I prefer.

Can anyone tell me what can I do after completing this cohort. Advice are welcomed too and what stack do you recommend me to go for after rust like I want to do rust for around 3 to 4 years master it completely then learn a new stack that goes along with Rust for web3 and stuff. Im thinking to go with solidity and stuff.
