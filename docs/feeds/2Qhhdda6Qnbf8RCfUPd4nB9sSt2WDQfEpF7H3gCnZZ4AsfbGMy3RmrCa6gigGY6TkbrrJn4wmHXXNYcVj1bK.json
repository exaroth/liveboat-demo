With a bit of smart engineering, much more powerful and flexible. A Loco starter is now described with a <code>rhai</code> script, which prepares the ground for anyone to create their own Loco starters, see our default one here: <a href=\"https://github.com/loco-rs/loco/blob/master/loco-new/setup.rhai\">https://github.com/loco-rs/loco/blob/master/loco-new/setup.rhai</a></p> <p>* First class <a href=\"https://loco.rs/docs/processing/workers/\">background jobs</a> experience. We now support <code>sqlite</code> as well as: <code>postgres</code>, <code>redis</code> (<code>valkey</code>), <code>async</code> (threads), <code>foreground</code>.</p> <p>* <a href=\"https://github.com/loco-rs/admin-jobs\">Background jobs admin</a>, standalone project with UI and all, <a href=\"https://github.com/loco-rs/admin-jobs\">https://github.com/loco-rs/admin-jobs</a>, built on Loco, to manage your background jobs with ease.</p> <p>If you haven&#39;t yet given Loco a try, start here: <a href=\"https://loco.rs/docs/getting-started/tour/\">https://loco.rs/docs/getting-started/tour/</a> . It takes 5 minutes to get a full CRUD app running with authentication and everything.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jondot1\"> /u/jondot1 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1h7w3ai/loco_v013_released_background_jobs_wsqlite_jobs/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1h7w3ai/loco_v013_released_background_jobs_wsqlite_jobs/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Then the code ran ~50% slower! I tried with i8, i16, u16 all with about the same performance as using u8. Changing to u32 didn&#39;t make a difference compared to i32, and using u64/i64 made it 73% slower.</p> <p>I don&#39;t know the x86_64 instructions, but I&#39;ve assumed the cost of widening the types would be free on a superscalar architecture even if it needed special instructions to do so. What else could cause the slowdown? Worse hashing performance?</p> <p>---- Edit after comments:</p> <p>The code is here: <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/y0xVWHfs\">https://pastebin.com/y0xVWHfs</a></p> <p>It uses these crates:<br/> aoc-runner = &quot;0.3.0&quot;<br/> aoc-runner-derive = &quot;0.3.0&quot;</p> <p>but one could just include the input file and add a main that calls input_generator with it, followed by calling solve_part2 with the result from input_generator.</p> <p>I&#39;ve benchmarked it with cargo-aoc bench, it compiles the code in release mode when benchmarking. It only benchmarks the solve_part2 function, not the input_generator call.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ClimberSeb\"> /u/ClimberSeb </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1h7wqx6/why_is_u32i32_faster_than_u8/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1h7wqx6/why_is_u32i32_faster_than_u8/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Recently I released a new minor version of <a href=\"https://github.com/Voultapher/self_cell\">self_cell</a> that adds a <a href=\"https://github.com/Voultapher/self_cell/pull/36\">long</a> requested feature: mutable references to the owner. In the past I was reluctant to add this feature because the core of the library is exceedingly tricky to get right, and I had to yank versions off of crates.io half a dozen times over the years - something every other serious self referential crate had to do as well, getting them right, especially variance, is extremely difficult - and even had a <a href=\"https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0070.html\">RUSTSEC advisory</a>. So given my design goal of keeping the crate minimal and avoiding unnecessary changes to the existing <code>unsafe</code> code, I had given up on adding this feature, but earlier this year someone raised the topic again and I had an idea for how to add this functionality without having to change the existing code. In essence I unknowingly re-derived the <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefMut.html#method.leak\"><code>RefCell::leak</code></a> API. Users can now wrap the owner in the crate provided type <a href=\"https://docs.rs/self_cell/1.1.0/self_cell/struct.MutBorrow.html\"><code>MutBorrow</code></a> which allows a <code>(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;mut T </code> transition, <em>but only once</em>. This way the existing APIs, documentation and code all stay the same but the wrapper type adds support for common use-cases such as <code>ZipArchive</code> etc.</p> <p>This brings self_cell closer to feature parity with <a href=\"https://github.com/someguynamedjosh/ouroboros\">ouroboros</a>. If you are happy with ouroboros there is no need to switch, it has also been reviewed extensively and has capabilities self_cell lacks. The renewed issue was raised by one of the rusqlite maintainers who wants to migrate to it because self_cell generates less code and is faster to compile, so if you&#39;re usage of ouroboros is feature compatible with self_cell and you care about compile times and or binary-size this might be avenue for improvement in your project.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Voultapher\"> /u/Voultapher </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1h7xpy9/announcing_self_cell_version_110/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1h7xpy9/announcing_self_cell_version_110/\">[comments]</a></span>",
