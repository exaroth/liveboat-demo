It has made Linux so much more accessible for beginners and casual users who aren&#39;t interested in diving deep into the inner workings of Linux but just want to use their PC without relying on Windows.</p> <p>I get that Flatpak has its downsides, like consuming more storage space in general, but the benefits far outweigh these negatives. Before I started using Flatpak, and was relying on traditional package managers like apt or dnf, I would always run into issues after a while that I had to Google and troubleshoot (of course, that&#39;s part of the IT life). Dependency problems and other headaches were a constant struggle. But ever since I switched to Flatpak, I can reliably expect my PC to just work about 98% of the time.</p> <p>Learning Linux in-depth is great, especially in a VM where you don&#39;t have to worry about losing important data—it&#39;s fun to break things and figure out how to fix them. But if you&#39;re just looking to have a working PC without all the hassle of configuring things or dealing with weird issues, Flatpak is a godsend.</p> <p>Canonical does something similar with Snap, and I fully understand the dislike people have for Snap. However, I think the containerized way of installing software is exactly what non-tech-savvy users need when they want a working PC without the need of using Windows.</p> <p>I’m sure Flatpak has its own downsides if you dig deeper, but for the average user, it’s a massive positive addition to Linux.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MaleficentTry1316\"> /u/MaleficentTry1316 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1h7ze64/why_flatpak_is_a_blessing_for_linux_beginners_and/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1h7ze64/why_flatpak_is_a_blessing_for_linux_beginners_and/\">[comments]</a></span>",
