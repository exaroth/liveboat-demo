The country is a major producer of gold, oil and cocoa, but it's struggling to recover from a debt crisis, leaving Ghanaians questioning their nation's economic direction.\nBattling in the elections for a chance to change those fortunes are Vice-President Mahamudu Bawumia, representing the ruling New Patriotic Party, and former President John Dramani Mahama of the main opposition National Democratic Congress.\nGhana has sustained its reputation as one of Africa's most stable democracies and it's ensured largely smooth transfers of power between its main political parties. It now has another opportunity to continue this pattern and avoid the insecurity and military coups that have engulfed some of its neighbors. But some observers have warned that Ghana's democracy is showing signs of fragility, making this election a defining moment in charting a way forward.\n\n00:00 Ghana votes\n06:55 DW speaks with journalist Christiana Sweety Aborchie of the Joy TV news channel in Accra\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#Ghana #Elections #Economy","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/CJ7GEbkwYb0?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Tallinn Christmas market","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1h8q4oa/tallinn_christmas_market/","date":1733569058,"author":"/u/EUstrongerthanUS","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1h8q4oa/tallinn_christmas_market/\"> <img src=\"https://preview.redd.it/0blgvlshqe5e1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed433d4fb5f08d0a358ffcf82f1c716fe3b183d3\" alt=\"Tallinn Christmas market\" title=\"Tallinn Christmas market\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EUstrongerthanUS\"> /u/EUstrongerthanUS </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/0blgvlshqe5e1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1h8q4oa/tallinn_christmas_market/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"NATO and Europe’s new ‘Cold War’","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2CShJTHz5s","date":1733570388,"author":"Reuters","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"As the war between Russia and Ukraine rages, trouble is brewing for NATO’s EU countries.
