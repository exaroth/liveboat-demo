Host Nina Haase speaks to DW's Michaela K√ºfner and migration expert Raphael Bossong from SWP think tank about where Germany stands-almost ten years after Angela Merkel said \"we can do this\" about taking in more than a million people.\n\nKey discussions include:\n\nThe potential impact on the German labor market if a large number of Syrians were to return to Syria\nThe varying statuses of Syrians in Germany and the implications of these differences\nThe evolution of German conservatives‚Äô migration policies since Angela Merkel\nThe role of migration and asylum policies in the current German election campaign\n\nüîî Subscribe to the DW Berlin Briefing podcast for more insightful analysis on global affairs.
