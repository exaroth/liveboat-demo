The debate over possible scenarios for ending the war is intensifying every day, as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office in Washington. He has vowed to end the war quickly. Ukraine is under heavy pressure from intense waves of Russian attacks, despite promises of more weapons from Germany and the US. Trump's designated special envoy for Ukraine, General Keith Kellogg, has a plan to bring Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table. \nBut will Putin even consider it? President Zelenskyy may have to pay a high price for peace, especially if he wants to get the NATO protection he hopes for by temporarily giving up some territories…\n\nOn To the Point, we ask: War and Peace: A Deal with Putin at the Expense of Ukraine?\n\n#tothepoint #Russia #Ukraine\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1",

      "content": "French President Emmanuel Macron addressed the nation on Thursday, hours after Prime Minister Michel Barnier handed in his resignation following Wednesday's vote of no-confidence. Macron rejected calls from the opposition to follow Barnier in stepping down, saying he would remain in office until the next presidential election in 2027.\n\nHe vowed to \"appoint a prime minister in the coming days\" saying that this person would be tasked with forming a \"government of general interest\" in order to pass a budget. The president also accused the left-wing and far-right parties that voted to topple the prime minister of being an \"anti-republican front. They are not thinking about your lives, let's be honest. They are thinking of just one thing: the presidential election,\" he said during his televised address.\n\nBarnier hands in resignation\nBarnier met with Macron at the Elysee Palace in Paris on Thursday to submit his resignation, making him the shortest-serving prime minister in modern French history. \"The prime minister today submitted the resignation of his government\" to Macron, who has \"taken note\" of the resignation, the Elysee said. Barnier and his ministers remain \"in charge of daily business until the appointment of a new government,\" it added. The premier stepped down after lawmakers voted to oust his minority government in a no-confidence motion on Wednesday. The move came after Barnier forced through an unpopular budget bill in an attempt to cut France's high fiscal deficit. The plan contained tax increases and spending cuts worth €60 billion ($63.1 billion), aimed at bringing the deficit to 5% of economic output in 2025 from an estimated 6.1% this year. The aim is to trim the deficit down to 3% by 2029. It was seen as an attempt to steer the French economy into calmer waters. \n\nWhat will Macron do next?\nSome opposition politicians have called for Macron to step down. \"I believe that stability requires the departure of the president of the Republic,\" said Manuel Bompard, leader of the far-left France Unbowed party, on BFM TV Wednesday night. But Macron has dismissed such calls. \"I was elected to serve until 2027, and I will fulfill that mandate,\" he told reporters earlier this week. The political stalemate will likely continue as new parliamentary elections cannot be held until next summer. Macron is due to give a televised address to the nation at 8 p.m. (1900 GMT) on Thursday, where he's expected to outline his future course of action.\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1",

      "content": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is facing a confidence vote on December 16th. If he loses, as expected, Germany will have an election in February to choose a new parliament. That means that political parties are focused on the polls and preparing themselves for that contest in early 2025. Let's have a look at how polls suggest that the election would turn out. They're saying Chancellor Scholz's Social Democrats would win only around 16 percent of the vote. The conservative bloc of the CDU and the Bavarian CSU parties would be twice as strong - with 32%. The business-friendly, liberal FDP wouldn't get enough votes to be represented in the Bundestag. The far-right AfD party would likely achieve 18 percent. And the Left Party would fail to reach the 5% hurdle to score a place in parliament, but could still be represented by winning three local candidates. This remains unclear for now. A new party, the BSW, could make it into parliament. It's polling at 5 percent with a blend of left-leaning economic policies with conservative migration and Russia-friendly foreign policy initiatives. Does this mean that Chancellor Scholz has already lost this election?\n\nPollsters also asked people what they see as the biggest challenges facing Germany right now: 45% see the economy as the biggest problem, 38 percentage points more than just a month ago. Migration is next, with 23% and the fear of war is at 18%. The big losers in this are environmental protection and climate change. Once named as people's main fear, only 12% of German voters still see environmental protection and climate change as the most pressing problem.\n\n#Germany #Germanelections \nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1",

Where that leaves Germany as Europe’s largest economy, is at the core of this week’s Berlin Briefing. DW’s Chief International Editor Richard Walker maps out the fact Germany’s chancellor and foreign minister still have “profoundly different views of the relationship that Germany has with China.” This fuels indecision between cooperation and rivalry and meets Chinese pro-trade “pragmatism”, a strategy DW’s Taiwan Bureau Chief Tsou Tzung Han warns could leave Germany’s security interests unaddressed. DW’s Chief Political Editor Michaela Küfner hosts this edition of Berlin Briefing that unpacks some tough policy questions on China that the next German government will have to address.\n\nKey discussions include:\n\nWhy there is and isn’t a link between Taiwan and Ukraine\nHow China’s silence on supporting Russia serves both sides\nWhy trade often trumps security concerns on China\nHow Germany’s role in Asia is limited\nWhy German diplomats are so impressed with China’s official lunch\n\n🔔 Subscribe to the DW Berlin Briefing podcast for more insightful analysis on global affairs.
