The Ukrainians say the mercenaries will probably come from Russia’s \"Africa Corps\", a rebranded version of the state-funded Wagner Group. The Africa Corps has established a foothold across the continent, though exactly where its mercenaries are active -- and in what capacity -- is hard to ascertain. \n\nWhat is known is that they're heavily involved in northern and western Africa. Russian mercenaries are fighting in Libya's civil war, as well as propping up the anti-western military juntas in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. And they're particulary influential in the Central African Republic, which signed a security pact with Russia in 2018. \n\nChapters:\n0:00 The reports of how Russia could find a new way to help Assad\n0:45 Philip Obaji, Investigative Journalist\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.yo\n#syria #russia #wagnergroup",

On paper, it sounds like the perfect product, but the company has been struggling for years. \n \nSales have slumped in the face of stiff competition from the likes of BMW, Mercedes and Audi. In 2021, Jaguar took the bold decision to ditch its petrol past and reinvent itself as a maker of exclusively electric luxury vehicles. Last month, its marketing team gave the world a first glimpse of the company's new vision.
