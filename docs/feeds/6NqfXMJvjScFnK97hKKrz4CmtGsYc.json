They also discussed the current situation and how strong and important the support from Europe has become over the last year.  \nUstinova said that Trump's multiple meetings with Zelensky indicate that Ukraine is a priority for him and that he has a crucial role in resolving the conflict. \nIn the interview, Oleksandra Ustinova emphasized the approach needed to negotiate with Putin, stating: \"To negotiate with Putin, you have to punch him first, then punch him again and then sit down at the negotiation table.\" This suggests that she believes in demonstrating strength and resolve before engaging in discussions.  \nRegarding her hopes for Trump, Ustinova expressed confidence that, as a negotiator and businessman, Trump understands the importance of presenting a strong front. She mentioned that she has \"big hopes that there will be a change of attitude and deliverables will be speeded up,\" indicating her belief that Trump could potentially expedite the delivery of weapons and support to Ukraine, thereby improving their position for negotiations.  \nUstinova stressed the importance of receiving adequate weapons and new technologies to strengthen Ukraine's position for negotiations. She reiterated that without these resources, Ukraine remains at a weak negotiating stance against Russia.  \nUstinova mentioned that many Republican senators support providing advanced weaponry to Ukraine, indicating a potential shift in U.S. policy towards stronger military assistance, which has been crucial for Ukraine's defense.  \nShe highlighted the increasing role of European nations in supporting Ukraine, noting that a significant portion of military aid and resources has come from Europe rather than the United States. This reflects a growing recognition in Europe of the war's implications for their security. \n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFor more news, analysis and background information on the German election 2025 go to our dedicated page: https://www.dw.com/en/german-election-2025/t-70794502\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n‚ñ∫Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n‚ñ∫TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n‚ñ∫Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n‚ñ∫Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nF√ºr Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\n#Ukraine #VladimirPutin #DonaldTrump","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/edUy3_2LKOg?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"NATO air policing missions around Estonia see F-35 and Rafale jets intercept multiple Russian aircraft","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1he5d80/nato_air_policing_missions_around_estonia_see_f35/","date":1734190465,"author":"/u/BothZookeepergame612","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1he5d80/nato_air_policing_missions_around_estonia_see_f35/\"> <img src=\"https://external-preview.redd.it/YEkE-iPkD6mUvAUA9lEDuxtcr2Yr5B6wMVi5QAcPnMI.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=303fa374b1352640a0838d3dcde6e5eb97a0d5c1\" alt=\"NATO air policing missions around Estonia see F-35 and Rafale jets intercept multiple Russian aircraft\" title=\"NATO air policing missions around Estonia see F-35 and Rafale jets intercept multiple Russian aircraft\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BothZookeepergame612\"> /u/BothZookeepergame612 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/f-35-rafale-jets-intercept-russian-planes-nato-missions-2024-12\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1he5d80/nato_air_policing_missions_around_estonia_see_f35/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Georgia lawmakers elect hardline critic of West as president | REUTERS","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keb3KwY4a9k","date":1734192681,"author":"Reuters","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Mikheil Kavelashvili, a hardline critic of the West and former soccer player, was named president of Georgia, after 224 out of 225 members of Georgia's electoral college voted for him.\n#News #georgia #election  #Reuters #Newsfeed \n\nRead the story here: https://reut.rs/3VGGhrP \n\nüëâ Subscribe: http://smarturl.it/reuterssubscribe\n\nKeep up with the latest news from around the world: https://www.reuters.com/\nFollow Reuters on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Reuters\nFollow Reuters on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/reuters/?hl=en","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/Keb3KwY4a9k?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"South Korea: Impeached Yoon says pause in presidency 'temporary' | DW News","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no2ZgJVBXUo","date":1734193745,"author":"DW News","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Less than two weeks after his short-lived martial law decree, South Korea's president has been impeached and suspended.
