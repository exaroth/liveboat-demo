Foreign ministers from the alliance are due to start two days of meetings focusing on supporting Kyiv's continuing defence against Russia. \nThe elephant in the room is US president-elect Donald Trump. He has repeatedly threatened to withdraw from NATO - and to not defend member states if they were attacked. \nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky suggested that he could agree to a ceasefire with Russia if NATO extends its protection to the parts of the country controlled by Ukraine. The alliance has so far declined to offer Ukraine membership over concerns that the war with Russia would escalate into a conflict involving NATO. \n\n#ukraine #nato #trump \nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1",
