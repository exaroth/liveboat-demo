rendering","url":"https://mizu.sh/","date":1734632755,"author":"lowlighter","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"\n<p>Hey HN,<p>I'd like to share a fun project I've been working on: mizu.js.<p>It's a js library that add functional attributes support into your html, designed to be a simple and flexible alternative to fully-fledged web frameworks (such as Vue, React, and Angular), while offering more capabilities than other lightweight options (like Alpine.js and htmx).<p>As it's written using modern ES features and due to its isomorphic nature, it can be run in both browsers and runtimes (Node, Deno, Bun) without any changes.\nThis makes it ideal for client-side and server-side rendering, as well as static site generation, whichever environment you prefer.<p>Just include the script in any web page (or backend) to get started. \nYou can template content, bind attributes, add interactivity, handle HTTP interactions, create custom components, and much more — all out of the box, without any configuration, transpilation steps, or builds.<p>I hope you'll find mizu.js as exciting and useful as I do and I'd love to get your feedback!\nYou can learn more about it at <a href=\"https://mizu.sh\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://mizu.sh</a>!<p>Online playground: <a href=\"https://mizu.sh/playground\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://mizu.sh/playground</a> \nCustom builder: <a href=\"https://mizu.sh/build\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://mizu.sh/build</a>\nCode coverage: <a href=\"https://mizu.sh/coverage\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://mizu.sh/coverage</a>\nGitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/lowlighter/mizu\">https://github.com/lowlighter/mizu</a><p>## Motivation ##<p>Nowadays, setting up a complete environment and installing thousands of packages is often required just to create a simple \"Hello World\" page. \nYet, with the current ECMAScript standard, vanilla JS has never been more powerful. \nIt offers built-in custom HTML components, proxies for changes tracking, weak references for better memory management, and many new data structures and methods.<p>So why is web development still insanely complex?<p>mizu.js aims to avoid adding bloat on top of native features, and instead focus on providing convenience helpers. \nIt's basically \"glue\" around all these native features with added sugar, a recipe for a lightweight yet powerful utility.<p>All evaluated expressions are interpreted as vanilla JavaScript, and you add your instructions directly into your HTML. \nSo if you know already know about JS/HTML, then you're already 80% know of how to use mizu.js (add an extra 10% if you've used Vue, Alpine.js or htmx in the past as some syntax and concepts are inspired by it), the rest is basically just remembering the directive names. \nThe learning curve is that small.<p>Also, you may have heard of <a href=\"https://matcha.mizu.sh\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://matcha.mizu.sh</a>, a CSS stylesheet to instantly make your web page stylized. \nWell, it's a great companion to mizu.js. With both of them, you can create MVPs for your projects super fast!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42464310\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42464310</a></p>\n<p>Points: 200</p>\n<p># Comments: 79</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Music and Geometry: Intervals and Scales","url":"https://roelsworld.eu/blog-music/music-geometry-intervals-scales/","date":1734634363,"author":"coloneltcb","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://roelsworld.eu/blog-music/music-geometry-intervals-scales/\">https://roelsworld.eu/blog-music/music-geometry-intervals-scales/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42464557\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42464557</a></p>\n<p>Points: 178</p>\n<p># Comments: 52</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Kelly Can't Fail","url":"https://win-vector.com/2024/12/19/kelly-cant-fail/","date":1734649635,"author":"jmount","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://win-vector.com/2024/12/19/kelly-cant-fail/\">https://win-vector.com/2024/12/19/kelly-cant-fail/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42466676\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42466676</a></p>\n<p>Points: 328</p>\n<p># Comments: 90</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"A Gentle Introduction to Graph Neural Networks","url":"https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/","date":1734667842,"author":"misonic","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/\">https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42468214\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42468214</a></p>\n<p>Points: 246</p>\n<p># Comments: 27</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Tldraw Computer","url":"https://computer.tldraw.com/","date":1734680556,"author":"duck","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"\n<p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://computer.tldraw.com\">https://computer.tldraw.com</a></p>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42469074\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42469074</a></p>\n<p>Points: 348</p>\n<p># Comments: 73</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Show HN: Artemis, a Calm Web Reader","url":"https://artemis.jamesg.blog/","date":1734708530,"author":"zerojames","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"\n<p>Earlier this year, I made a web reader that only showed a list of post titles, author domains, and links.

Every morning, I looked forward to my \"morning paper\" of blogs I love reading.<p>There are no notifications, read vs. unread states, counts of posts, etc. Only the last seven days of posts are available. The colour scheme is changeable. Dark mode is supported. All popular feed formats are supported.<p>There is no reading interface to read blog posts; rather, the links take you to the authors' websites.
