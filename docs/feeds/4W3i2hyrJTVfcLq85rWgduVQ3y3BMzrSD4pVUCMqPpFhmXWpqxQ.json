Some time ago I realized that some architectures potentially much superior to the classic VonNeumann, have been forgotten because there were no reliable technical solutions to implement them.\nOne of these architectures particularly struck me and it is the \"Dataflow architecture\", in which there is no Program counter, but the instructions are executed in real contemporaneity whenever the operands are available.\nIn trying to find a technical solution that implements this type of architecture effectively (spoiler: yes, maybe I succeeded but I still have to test the real correct functioning!) I realized that this solution works more than well with three logical states. And at this point I discovered that perhaps it is better to implement a CPU with three states (ternary) instead of a white one. This as a first step to realize my dataflow solution.\nObviously a world has opened up to me regarding ternary CPUs, I have discovered not only that they are the best solution implemented for a computing device, but also that an increasing number of university and researcher papers are dealing with them in recent times.\nThis is also thanks to the enormous potential compared to normal CPUs; lower circuit complexity (and also lower consumption and lower heat production) but at the same time the truly formidable information representation capabilities compared to binary counterparts!\nSo here I am creating this ternary CPU and all the hardware and software to be able to use it immediately. In the link you have found some other details, but obviously for questions, suggestions or anything else you can insert your comment here!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a
