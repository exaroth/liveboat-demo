The reader only updated once per day, so I wouldn't feel compelled to keep checking for new posts.<p>I have been using the tool, which I called Artemis, for several months. Every morning, I looked forward to my \"morning paper\" of blogs I love reading.<p>There are no notifications, read vs. unread states, counts of posts, etc. Only the last seven days of posts are available. The colour scheme is changeable. Dark mode is supported. All popular feed formats are supported.<p>There is no reading interface to read blog posts; rather, the links take you to the authors' websites. Many of my favourite bloggers put a lot of effort into the design of their blogs and like to change things up; I wanted an experience that embraced that.<p>The reader is now available for anyone to use (with invite code \"hn\").</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42471913\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42471913</a></p>\n<p>Points: 181</p>\n<p>#
