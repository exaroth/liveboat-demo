I've since found that this use case fits really well into the Svelte compiler-based approach and its fine-grained reactivity system.<p>In general, I think using shaders like these has some really positive upsides compared to traditional ways of doing graphics on the web — not just for games and stuff, but also for something like data visualizations and aesthetic details. My dream is that one day, you'll see web developers using small, isolated shader components ubiquitously across web applications, just as naturally as something like SVGs are used today.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42416230\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42416230</a></p>\n<p>Points: 179</p>\n<p># Comments: 41</p>\n","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Show HN: A simple web game to help learn chords and basic progressions","url":"https://chords.yottanami.com/","date":1734174314,"author":"yottanami","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"\n<p>Hi Hacker News,<p>I've created Chord Nebula, a simple web-based game designed to help users learn and practice piano chords, basic progressions, and harmony fundamentals.
