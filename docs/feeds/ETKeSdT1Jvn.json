His death went almost entirely unnoticed by the British public, despite the fact that he carried out some of the most dramatic deception campaigns of World War Two. He waged a covert war of trickery and misdirection across Europe, which ended up getting him arrested by Spanish authorities while dressed as a woman. He also helped to found one of the world's preeminent special forces; the Special Air Service, or the SAS. His contribution is often overlooked, but without it, the SAS may well have never existed.</p><br><p>So who was Dudley Clarke? What were some of the most audacious acts of subterfuge he carried out?

What makes the AI revolution unique is that it transforms how we write software, and what software we write, and that these dual disruptions compound: AI makes it easier to write software, and smarter AI models make it easier to use AI in software.\n\n\nYet beyond the initial excitement lies a deeper change to software development that requires us to step out of our comfort zone as legacy processes, rooted in specifications, and automated testing confront a world of non-determinism and free-form human computer interaction.\n\n\nIn this talk we’ll dive into Vercel’s own journey from being a traditional software company to becoming an AI company, and how you can apply some of the same lessons to your own business.",

When successful companies first started out, they had to constantly deliver value to understand what their users wanted. This grew their business. Many large companies that have been around for decades, or even newer startups that have found some stability, fall into a dangerous place called “The Build Trap”. They continue building feature after feature, without stopping to validate it’s what customer truly want and need. This is due in part to poor understanding of Product Strategy, Product Management, and how to manage teams. In order to get out of “The Build Trap”, businesses need to restructure their thinking to focus on finding value for the user through experimentation to achieve business goals.",

But this kind of behavior shouldn't be that successful, right? Because after all, writing good software is about well-structured procedures and following protocol, right?! WRONG! In this presentation, we will talk about data structures that behave like THAT guy in the office. We will talk about the data structures that don't always do what you expect of them and get away with it more often than not. In this presentation, we will talk about probabilistic data structures.\n\n\nWe will start with skip lists that strike a perfect balance between linked lists and array lists in theory. But since maintaining the perfect skip list structure is infeasible in practice, we also explore how to structure imperfect skip lists that work \"well enough\" most of the time. To this end, we will compare basic coin flipping approaches with heuristic optimizations in a synoptic runtime analysis. We conclude the presentation with an overview of other probabilistic data structures like Bloom Filters and Count-Min Sketches, focusing on their probabilistic elements and providing practical examples of where and why they are used in applications.",

To listen to it, please choose \"English (United Kingdom)\" audio track, by clicking on: Settings (Gear Icon), Audio Track, Choose: English (United Kingdom). So, \"English (US)\" is the fully english dubbed track, and \"English (UK)\" is the original bilingual track. For the latter, you can turn on subtitles as well. For now, this is the best I can do. I will work with the YouTube team to figure out a better solution. I tried really hard to make this conversation as accessible as possible to people who speak only English or Spanish. I'll keep trying to figure out how to do this better. Your feedback is deeply appreciated. Thank you for listening. I love you all! ❤\n\n*Corrections/Clarifications in Translation:* \n- The English translation at 23:23 says \"fiscal deficit\" when it should say \"fiscal balance\".

In most of the world (except US) that means \"classical liberal\" which in US is better understood as \"libertarian\". \n\n*Switch between English & Spanish Versions:*\nThis podcast is translated and dubbed into Spanish.

Prioritizing is crucial in a startup, balancing bugs, hot fixes, new features, and improvements, focusing on impactful tasks to keep core functionalities unblocked. We don't use sprints or endless backlogs; instead, we prefer brainstorming sessions, with developers crossing roles to prevent bottlenecks.

He highlights the impact of Generative AI on code transparency and explains the Generative AI Bill of Materials (GBOM), which helps identify and manage risks in AI-generated code. This talk offers practical insights for technical and non-technical audiences, showing how proper diligence can enhance value and mitigate risks in machine learning operations.\n\n// Bio\nMatt Van Itallie is the Founder and CEO of Sema. He and his team have developed Comprehensive Codebase Scans, the most thorough and easily understandable assessment of a codebase and engineering organization. These scans are crucial for private equity and venture capital firms looking to make informed investment decisions. Sema has evaluated code within organizations that have a collective value of over $1 trillion. In 2023, Sema served 7 of the 9 largest global investors, along with market-leading strategic investors, private equity, and venture capital firms, providing them with critical insights.\n\nIn addition, Sema is at the forefront of Generative AI Code Transparency, which measures how much code created by GenAI is in a codebase. They are the inventors behind the Generative AI Bill of Materials (GBOM), an essential resource for investors to understand and mitigate risks associated with AI-generated code.\n\nBefore founding Sema, Matt was a Private Equity operating executive and a management consultant at McKinsey. He graduated from Harvard Law School and has had some interesting adventures, like hiking a third of the Appalachian Trail and biking from Boston to Seattle.\n\nFull bio: https://alistar.fm/bio/matt-van-itallie\n\n// MLOps Swag/Merch\nhttps://shop.mlops.community/\n\n// Related Links\nWebsite: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gschwind\n \n--------------- ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ -------------\nJoin our slack community: https://go.mlops.community/slack\nFollow us on Twitter: @mlopscommunity\nSign up for the next meetup: https://go.mlops.community/register\nCatch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: https://mlops.community/\n\nConnect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/\nConnect with Matt on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mvi/\n\n</p>\n</ituneshack>",

This turning point taught her the importance of adaptability in the tech industry's ups and downs.</p> <p>When Allison faced her own layoff, she found the strength to move on to new roles, including a position at Shopify. There, she had to announce layoffs to her team, learning to lead with empathy and prioritize their well-being.</p> <p>Her story highlights the power of empathy and resilience in leadership.

However, supporting reinforcement learning, decision-making, and control communities is equally crucial, as these fields drive innovation in areas like robotics, autonomous systems, and game-playing. This podcast explores the intersection of PyTorch and these fields, covering practical tips and tricks for working with PyTorch, an in-depth look at TorchRL, and discussions on debugging techniques, optimization strategies, and testing frameworks. By examining these topics, listeners will understand how to effectively use PyTorch for control systems and decision-making applications.\n\n// Bio\nVincent Moens is a research engineer on the PyTorch core team at Meta, based in London. As the maintainer of TorchRL (<a href=\"https://github.com/pytorch/rl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/pytorch/rl</a>) and TensorDict (<a href=\"https://github.com/pytorch/tensordict\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/pytorch/tensordict</a>), Vincent plays a key role in supporting the decision-making community within the PyTorch ecosystem. \n\nAlongside his technical role in the PyTorch community, Vincent also actively contributes to AI-related research projects.\n\nBefore joining Meta, Vincent worked as an ML researcher at Huawei and AIG. \n\nVincent holds a Medical Degree and a PhD in Computational Neuroscience.\n\n// MLOps Swag/Merch\n<a href=\"https://shop.mlops.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://shop.mlops.community/</a>\n\n// Related Links</p>\n<p>Musical recommendation: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/1Uff91EOsvd99rtAupatMP?si=jVkoFiq8Tmq0fqK_OIEglg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://open.spotify.com/artist/1Uff91EOsvd99rtAupatMP?si=jVkoFiq8Tmq0fqK_OIEglg</a>\nWebsite: <a href=\"github.com/vmoens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">github.com/vmoens</a>\nTorchRL: <a href=\"https://github.com/pytorch/rl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/pytorch/rl</a>\nTensorDict: <a href=\"https://github.com/pytorch/tensordict\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/pytorch/tensordict</a>\nLinkedIn post: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vincent-moens-9bb91972_join-the-tensordict-discord-server-activity-7189297643322253312-Wo9J?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vincent-moens-9bb91972_join-the-tensordict-discord-server-activity-7189297643322253312-Wo9J?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop</a>\n \n--------------- ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ -------------\nJoin our slack community: <a href=\"https://go.mlops.community/slack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://go.mlops.community/slack</a>\nFollow us on Twitter:<a href=\" @mlopscommunity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\"> @mlopscommunity</a>\nSign up for the next meetup: <a href=\"https://go.mlops.community/register\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://go.mlops.community/register</a>\nCatch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: <a href=\"https://mlops.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://mlops.community/</a>\n\nConnect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/</a>\nConnect with Vincent on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mvi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/mvi/</a></p>\n</ituneshack>",
