When successful companies first started out, they had to constantly deliver value to understand what their users wanted. This grew their business. Many large companies that have been around for decades, or even newer startups that have found some stability, fall into a dangerous place called “The Build Trap”. They continue building feature after feature, without stopping to validate it’s what customer truly want and need. This is due in part to poor understanding of Product Strategy, Product Management, and how to manage teams. In order to get out of “The Build Trap”, businesses need to restructure their thinking to focus on finding value for the user through experimentation to achieve business goals.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/gGiEM4toNig?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Most of the Time It Works Every Time: The Mindset Behind Using Probabilistic Data Structures","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daE6uhlFie8","date":1732022668,"author":"code.talks (ehem.

But this kind of behavior shouldn't be that successful, right? Because after all, writing good software is about well-structured procedures and following protocol, right?! WRONG! In this presentation, we will talk about data structures that behave like THAT guy in the office. We will talk about the data structures that don't always do what you expect of them and get away with it more often than not. In this presentation, we will talk about probabilistic data structures.\n\n\nWe will start with skip lists that strike a perfect balance between linked lists and array lists in theory. But since maintaining the perfect skip list structure is infeasible in practice, we also explore how to structure imperfect skip lists that work \"well enough\" most of the time. To this end, we will compare basic coin flipping approaches with heuristic optimizations in a synoptic runtime analysis. We conclude the presentation with an overview of other probabilistic data structures like Bloom Filters and Count-Min Sketches, focusing on their probabilistic elements and providing practical examples of where and why they are used in applications.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/daE6uhlFie8?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Why HTMX is crushing React, Vue & Svelte","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o5dn4ts4zM","date":1732023396,"author":"code.talks (ehem.

However, supporting reinforcement learning, decision-making, and control communities is equally crucial, as these fields drive innovation in areas like robotics, autonomous systems, and game-playing. This podcast explores the intersection of PyTorch and these fields, covering practical tips and tricks for working with PyTorch, an in-depth look at TorchRL, and discussions on debugging techniques, optimization strategies, and testing frameworks. By examining these topics, listeners will understand how to effectively use PyTorch for control systems and decision-making applications.\n\n// Bio\nVincent Moens is a research engineer on the PyTorch core team at Meta, based in London. As the maintainer of TorchRL (<a href=\"https://github.com/pytorch/rl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/pytorch/rl</a>) and TensorDict (<a href=\"https://github.com/pytorch/tensordict\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/pytorch/tensordict</a>), Vincent plays a key role in supporting the decision-making community within the PyTorch ecosystem. \n\nAlongside his technical role in the PyTorch community, Vincent also actively contributes to AI-related research projects.\n\nBefore joining Meta, Vincent worked as an ML researcher at Huawei and AIG. \n\nVincent holds a Medical Degree and a PhD in Computational Neuroscience.\n\n// MLOps Swag/Merch\n<a href=\"https://shop.mlops.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://shop.mlops.community/</a>\n\n// Related Links</p>\n<p>Musical recommendation: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/1Uff91EOsvd99rtAupatMP?si=jVkoFiq8Tmq0fqK_OIEglg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://open.spotify.com/artist/1Uff91EOsvd99rtAupatMP?si=jVkoFiq8Tmq0fqK_OIEglg</a>\nWebsite: <a href=\"github.com/vmoens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">github.com/vmoens</a>\nTorchRL: <a href=\"https://github.com/pytorch/rl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/pytorch/rl</a>\nTensorDict: <a href=\"https://github.com/pytorch/tensordict\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/pytorch/tensordict</a>\nLinkedIn post: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vincent-moens-9bb91972_join-the-tensordict-discord-server-activity-7189297643322253312-Wo9J?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vincent-moens-9bb91972_join-the-tensordict-discord-server-activity-7189297643322253312-Wo9J?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop</a>\n \n--------------- ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ -------------\nJoin our slack community: <a href=\"https://go.mlops.community/slack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://go.mlops.community/slack</a>\nFollow us on Twitter:<a href=\" @mlopscommunity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\"> @mlopscommunity</a>\nSign up for the next meetup: <a href=\"https://go.mlops.community/register\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://go.mlops.community/register</a>\nCatch all episodes, blogs, newsletters, and more: <a href=\"https://mlops.community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://mlops.community/</a>\n\nConnect with Demetrios on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpbrinkm/</a>\nConnect with Vincent on LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mvi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/mvi/</a></p>\n</ituneshack>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/95312154/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2024-11-3%2F390930188-44100-2-7d7396ed93203.mp3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"CodeSandbox with Ives van Hoorne","url":"https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2024/12/04/codesandbox-with-ives-van-hoorne/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=codesandbox-with-ives-van-hoorne","date":1733306457,"author":"SEDaily","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<p><a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/\">CodeSandbox</a> was founded in 2017 and provides cloud based development environments along with other features.
