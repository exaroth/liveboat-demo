After the Assad regime was toppled, the German government decided to suspend asylum proceedings for Syrian citizens. The debate in Germany has been heating up since then- not least because political parties are attempting to stress their differences even more than usual: We properly entered election campaign period this week, after all, with German chancellor Olaf Scholz losing the requested vote of confidence in parliament, paving the way for elections on February 23rd. Host Nina Haase speaks to DW's Michaela Küfner and migration expert Raphael Bossong from SWP think tank about where Germany stands-almost ten years after Angela Merkel said \"we can do this\" about taking in more than a million people.\n\nKey discussions include:\n\nThe potential impact on the German labor market if a large number of Syrians were to return to Syria\nThe varying statuses of Syrians in Germany and the implications of these differences\nThe evolution of German conservatives’ migration policies since Angela Merkel\nThe role of migration and asylum policies in the current German election campaign\n\n🔔 Subscribe to the DW Berlin Briefing podcast for more insightful analysis on global affairs.
