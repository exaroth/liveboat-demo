Many in Taipei point to how Beijing has imposed a harsh national security law in Hong Kong—despite pledges of allowing the former British colony to maintain autonomy under the model of “one country, two systems.” Many also remember how Taiwanese identity was repressed under Nationalist-rule on the island. Democracy and civil rights are now central to Taiwanese identity. But for Beijing promoting “separatism” is a crime.  Even speeches from Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te have led to massive Chinese displays of military force.  Taiwan’s main political parties have different strategies on how to avoid conflict and being pressured by Beijing. The KMT say provoking China could lead to war and the governing DPP argue Taiwan must deter China.

City spokesperson Michael Reif said there were \"numerous injured,\" with media reports suggesting that number to be around 70.  Police have taken the driver into custody, according to local government sources cited by Germany's dpa news agency. Authorities say the individual, a Saudi national, is not known to have Islamist ties. Authorities have closed the Christmas market and emergency services are at the scene. A spokesperson for Magdeburg University Hospital told dpa that the first 10-20 victims have already arrived at the facility, adding, \"We are currently gearing up [for more]. Intensive care beds are ready.\" No information about the driver of the car been released and despite wild public speculation on social media sites authorities in Magdeburg have avoided any statement on a possible motive. Friday's incident did, nevertheless, trigger memories of a 2016 attack on a Berlin Christmas market. That crime, perpetrated by an Islamist in a stolen truck, killed 13 and injured more than 70.","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/h9ks2NGTAqE?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Poland Threatens to Arrest Netanyahu for War Crimes If He Attends Holocaust Memorial Ceremony","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1hits3v/poland_threatens_to_arrest_netanyahu_for_war/","date":1734728815,"author":"/u/PostHeraldTimes","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1hits3v/poland_threatens_to_arrest_netanyahu_for_war/\"> <img src=\"https://external-preview.redd.it/h0mozNt2493SQVOeoegk0XHoqd0647yIXcFHB3zQaB8.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ea4952307f9340bd47eeebadd79dd50e55f0e78\" alt=\"Poland Threatens to Arrest Netanyahu for War Crimes If He Attends Holocaust Memorial Ceremony\" title=\"Poland Threatens to Arrest Netanyahu for War Crimes If He Attends Holocaust Memorial Ceremony\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PostHeraldTimes\"> /u/PostHeraldTimes </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.latintimes.com/poland-threatens-arrest-netanyahu-war-crimes-if-he-attends-holocaust-memorial-ceremony-569968\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1hits3v/poland_threatens_to_arrest_netanyahu_for_war/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"After Damascus meeting, US drops $10 million terror bounty for new Syrian leader","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1hitqc2/after_damascus_meeting_us_drops_10_million_terror/","date":1734728671,"author":"/u/DoremusJessup","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1hitqc2/after_damascus_meeting_us_drops_10_million_terror/\"> <img src=\"https://external-preview.redd.it/xyIErC7ubf5sXx6NcZXb9VI0VAjo8bn4aIPpo7E6x4Q.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2795dbfd5aab1c4f93070a81e2db08b0abe73733\" alt=\"After Damascus meeting, US drops $10 million terror bounty for new Syrian leader\" title=\"After Damascus meeting, US drops $10 million terror bounty for new Syrian leader\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DoremusJessup\"> /u/DoremusJessup </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-damascus-meeting-us-drops-10-million-terror-bounty-for-new-syrian-leader/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1hitqc2/after_damascus_meeting_us_drops_10_million_terror/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Is Elon Musk interfering in Germany's election? | DW News","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcJcffmrkVU","date":1734728425,"author":"DW News","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"For more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFor more news, analysis and background information on the German election 2025 go to our dedicated page: https://www.dw.com/en/german-election-2025/t-70794502\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/NcJcffmrkVU?version=3","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Angry residents of cyclone-hit Mayotte plead to Macron for water | REUTERS","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-pscF_4plk","date":1734724935,"author":"Reuters","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"‘Seven days, no water’: French President Emmanuel Macron's tour of Cyclone Chido-ravaged Mayotte was met with residents' ire over water scarcity.
