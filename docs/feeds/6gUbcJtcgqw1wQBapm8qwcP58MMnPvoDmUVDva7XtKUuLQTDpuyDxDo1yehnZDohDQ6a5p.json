As an open source permissively licensed project, teach-rs enables educators to share and improve resources, making introducing Rust instruction into their programs more accessible. Many institutions now use teach-rs in their courses, including the Slovak University of Technology, RustIEC (a collaboration between Vrije Universiteit Brussel and KU Leuven), and the University Politehnica of Bucharest. At the time of this writing, teach-rs has nearly 3000 stars on GitHub... \n\nUnder the guidance of The Rust Foundation's Global Rust Coordinator and Rust Nation UK's organizer Ernest Kissiedu, Mordecai Etukudo (Mart) has developed a guide to help educational institutions adopt Rust in their systems. This resource walks organizations through the entire implementation process, from initial assessment to community engagement.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=The+Rust+Foundation's+Plan+to+Grow+the+Pool+of+Well-Trained+Rust+Developers%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F2222220%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F05%2F2222220%2Fthe-rust-foundations-plan-to-grow-the-pool-of-well-trained-rust-developers%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://developers.slashdot.org/story/24/12/05/2222220/the-rust-foundations-plan-to-grow-the-pool-of-well-trained-rust-developers?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Mozilla Announces 'JavaScriptmas' - Daily Coding Challenges with a Chance at Prizes","url":"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/12/04/0138255/mozilla-announces-javascriptmas---daily-coding-challenges-with-a-chance-at-prizes?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1733499240,"author":"EditorDavid","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"Mozilla's developer blog is announcing \"JavaScriptmas\".\n\n [F]rom December 1st to December 24th, we will release a fun, daily coding challenge for you to solve on [code-learning platform] Scrimba. Each challenge comes with an introductory screencast called \"scrim\", some starter code, and then it's your turn to fill in the gaps. \n\nJavaScriptmas is about coding, learning, and the chance to win exciting prizes. Two lucky coders will be chosen as winners at the end of JavaScriptmas, and each will win a MacBook Air M3, swag from MDN and Scrimba, and a lifetime Scrimba Pro membership (worth ~$200 per year). The Scrimba membership will give you access to all courses, including the Frontend Developer Career Path based on the MDN curriculum. \nMost of the challenges will evolve around JavaScript algorithms. You will also practice subjects like DOM manipulation, UI design, CSS, accessibility, and even a bit of cyber security. The challenges are a collaborative effort from Scrimba teachers, mentors, and MDN content writers, all with the goal of turning you into a more well-rounded web developer. \nWinners will be chosen randomly from everyone who submits correct solutions. We want JavaScriptmas to be accessible for both beginners and experienced developers alike. That said, the more challenges you solve, the better your chances of winning! To maximize your chances, try to solve all 24 challenges and submit them as both regular entries and social entries. You don't have to submit your solutions on the same day they're published &mdash; the deadline for any submission is midnight UTC on Christmas Eve.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Mozilla+Announces+'JavaScriptmas'+-+Daily+Coding+Challenges+with+a+Chance+at+Prizes%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F04%2F0138255%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F24%2F12%2F04%2F0138255%2Fmozilla-announces-javascriptmas---daily-coding-challenges-with-a-chance-at-prizes%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://tech.slashdot.org/story/24/12/04/0138255/mozilla-announces-javascriptmas---daily-coding-challenges-with-a-chance-at-prizes?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Amazon Offers $100M in Cloud-Computing Credits for Education Projects Like 'AI Teaching Assistant'","url":"https://news.slashdot.org/story/24/12/07/1736233/amazon-offers-100m-in-cloud-computing-credits-for-education-projects-like-ai-teaching-assistant?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1733593140,"author":"EditorDavid","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"This week AWS pledged up to $100 million in cloud-computing credits for educational organizations over the next five years, to help them build \"technology-based learning experiences\" on AWS, including:\n AI assistants coding curriculums\n- connectivity tools student learning platforms mobile apps chatbots\n\nOne example shared by Amazon: The nonprofit Code.org will use AWS's cloud credits to scale their AI teaching assistant that \"has already helped teachers reduce the time they spend assessing students' coding projects by up to 50%.\" (Amazon's blog post notes that \"Improved efficiency means teachers have more time to work on personalized lesson plans and coach students\" &mdash; and that Code.org's assistant uses an AWS service for building AI tools...) \n\n$100 million sounds pretty generous.

The idea of programming seemed exclusively reserved for those fluent in syntax and logic. However, the narrative is now being challenged by natural language coding being implemented in AI tools like GitHub Copilot. Andrej Karpathy, senior director of AI at Tesla predicted this trend last year.... English is emerging as the universal coding language. \n\nNVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang believes that English is becoming a new programming language thanks to AI advancements. Speaking at the World Government Summit, Huang explained, \"It is our job to create computing technology such that nobody has to program and that the programming language is human\"... He calls this a \"miracle of AI,\" emphasising how it closes the technology divide and empowers people from all fields to become effective technologists without traditional coding skills... \"In the future, you will tell the computer what you want, and it will do it,\"&#226; Huang commented. Large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-4 and its successors have made this possible... \n\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella has been equally vocal about the potential of English for coding. Microsoft's GitHub Copilot, an AI code assistant, enables developers to describe their needs in natural language and receive functional code in response. Nadella describes this as part of a broader mission to \"empower every person and every organisation on the planet to achieve more\".... In a discussion earlier last year, Stability AI CEO Emad Mostaque claimed, \"41% of codes on GitHub are AI-generated\"... \n\nIn 2024, the ability to program is no longer reserved for a few. It's a skill anyone can wield, thanks to the power of natural language processing and AI\n \n\"No longer is the power to create software restricted to those who can decipher programming languages,\" the article concludes. \"Anyone with a problem to solve and a clear enough articulation of that problem can now write software.\" \n\nAlthough the article also includes this consoling quote from Nvidia's Huang in March. \"There is an artistry to prompt engineering.
