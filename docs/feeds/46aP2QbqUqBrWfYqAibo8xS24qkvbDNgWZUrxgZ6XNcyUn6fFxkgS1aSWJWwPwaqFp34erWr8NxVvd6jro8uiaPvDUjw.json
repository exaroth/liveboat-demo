I&#39;ve recently stood up a small Kubernetes cluster at home made out of three repurposed workstations that my workplace threw out. I do have a small NAS, and that&#39;s fine for most of my apps, but I run a local instance of Vaultwarden to manage passwords and I&#39;d like that to be as HA as possible for obvious reasons. The issue I have with just linking its volumes to the NAS like everything else is that if the NAS goes down, the volumes go down, which means Vaultwarden goes down -- single point of failure. I&#39;d like to be able to lose the NAS, or any individual node, while still keeping Vaultwarden up. The good news is that it reads way more than it writes, traffic overall is pretty light, and it doesn&#39;t store a lot of information -- less than 1GB.</p> <p>The two big options I&#39;ve seen are Longhorn and Rook. Longhorn looks great on paper, but I hear a lot of people talk about unreliability and issues with replicas going out of sync. Rook also looks pretty good, but the Ceph docs talk about specs my reimaged workstations don&#39;t have like 32GB of RAM for a small cluster. So what do you guys think is best for this kind of a use case with these limitations? Is distributed storage too much for such a small setup in the first place?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lyraeixis\"> /u/Lyraeixis </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1h995zz/ha_storage_options_for_a_small_baremetal_cluster/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1h995zz/ha_storage_options_for_a_small_baremetal_cluster/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"K8s Security Engineer","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1h9cne0/k8s_security_engineer/","date":1733638859,"author":"/u/ErenYeager_A0T","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Can anyone share their experience interviewing for a Kubernetes Security Engineer role?
