I&#39;m open to other deployment options as well. Right now It&#39;s just a single backend, monolith, and a Postgres instance.

If youâ€™re struggling with exposing services (external load balancer) securely in Kubernetes but donâ€™t have a static IP or canâ€™t change firewall configurations, the frp Kubernetes Operator might be the solution. This operator automates the deployment of frp (Fast Reverse Proxy) clients and tunnels, removing the need for complex ingress setups and firewall changes.</p> <p>With support for protocols like TCP, UDP, HTTP, and HTTPS, itâ€™s ideal for use cases such as home labs, self-hosted apps, or secure remote access. It also provides flexible, cost-effective exit servers and offers built-in encryption and compression for optimized performance.</p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/Aureum-Cloud/frp-Operator\">https://github.com/Aureum-Cloud/frp-Operator</a> Helm: <a href=\"https://frp-operator.aureum.cloud\">https://frp-operator.aureum.cloud</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/niekberenschot\"> /u/niekberenschot </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1h8do7q/kubernetes_operator_for_tunnels_frp_operator/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1h8do7q/kubernetes_operator_for_tunnels_frp_operator/\">[comments]</a></span>",
