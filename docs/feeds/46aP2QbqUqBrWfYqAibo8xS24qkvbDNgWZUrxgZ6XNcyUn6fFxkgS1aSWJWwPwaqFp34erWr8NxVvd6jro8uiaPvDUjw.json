Say I have 100 websites running on AKS but they have very low usage (like 1-4% of a CPU core) 99% of the time. So in theory I could fit everything on 4 cores. So I set the requests to be 0.04 of a core. Everything is good because the load is low and the actual node still is at like 80% idle. Now the load increases and everything is good because I have no cpu limit and it will use consume the idle resources. Now the load increases even more and suddenly there is trouble because the node can&#39;t keep up and the cluster autoscaler isn&#39;t scaling because the cpu-requests from the pods is low. Therefor I define a HPA and set it to scale at 80% CPU utilization. This turned out awful because now it scales when load reaches 80% of 0.04 of a core. The memory usage balloons and tons and tons of replicas and nodes are made.</p> <p>Is there a good solution to this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/assangeleakinglol\"> /u/assangeleakinglol </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1h7jkrf/how_do_i_achieve_maximum_density_for_bursty/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1h7jkrf/how_do_i_achieve_maximum_density_for_bursty/\">[comments]</a></span>",
