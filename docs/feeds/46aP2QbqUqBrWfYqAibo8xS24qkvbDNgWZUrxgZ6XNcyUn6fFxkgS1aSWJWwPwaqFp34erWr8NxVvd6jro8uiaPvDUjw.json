What this does is it shows me what my possibilities are, sometimes even with examples.</p> <p>The issue I&#39;m having with YAML files in Kubernetes is that <strong>I don&#39;t know what my possibilities are</strong>, especially when it comes to &quot;Custom Resource Definitions&quot; and custom object types (things besides Pod, Deployment, Service, etc...). It&#39;s hard for me to tell what is <em>required</em> to be in a yaml file vs what is <em>optional</em> as well.</p> <p>Are there any primers that you know of that cover this in depth, or at least provide some general rules of thumb? I did just watch a video from a channel called &quot;TechWorld with Nana&quot; which was helpful, but again, it mostly covered just those traditional builtin types such as Pod, Deployment, etc... And it only really talked about the main 3 &quot;metadata&quot;, &quot;spec&quot;, and &quot;status&quot; areas. But for example, I have attached a screenshot showing something confusing: Notice how on left side the `selector` has `matchLabels`, whereas on the right side it only has `selector` and no `matchLabels`. Why!??!? There seems to be no rhyme or reason to many of these and it&#39;s very difficult for me to learn.</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/08e6uh81bu6e1.png?width=1610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26ee5374466d9e0dfc164a8b75933560c18a7348\">https://preview.redd.it/08e6uh81bu6e1.png?width=1610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26ee5374466d9e0dfc164a8b75933560c18a7348</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Zamdi\"> /u/Zamdi </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1he6b5j/how_do_i_know_what_can_go_into_yaml_files_for/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1he6b5j/how_do_i_know_what_can_go_into_yaml_files_for/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Announcing General Availability of Bitnami Premium","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hecotc/announcing_general_availability_of_bitnami_premium/","date":1734210867,"author":"/u/onedr0p","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hecotc/announcing_general_availability_of_bitnami_premium/\"> <img src=\"https://external-preview.redd.it/mmNnDhSlpmLzkAIOmWfx9XPI03SgjCnejIoZDi5xExE.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=921213bbada1c36e1db4f5ddddae58f250ed84da\" alt=\"Announcing General Availability of Bitnami Premium\" title=\"Announcing General Availability of Bitnami Premium\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/onedr0p\"> /u/onedr0p </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://blog.bitnami.com/2024/11/bitnami-premium.html?m=1\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hecotc/announcing_general_availability_of_bitnami_premium/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Kubeflow Training Operator alternative","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hep080/kubeflow_training_operator_alternative/","date":1734254365,"author":"/u/Existing-Mirror2315","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Alternative Kubernetes custom sesource definition for distributing training workload across nodes.</p> <p>If no, Is it sufficient to use Kubeflow Training Operator as a standalone component.
