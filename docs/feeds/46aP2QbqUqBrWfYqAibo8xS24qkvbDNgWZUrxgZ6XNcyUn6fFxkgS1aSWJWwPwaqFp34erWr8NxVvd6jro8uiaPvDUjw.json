The issue resolved itself in a couple of minutes but to do a post-mortem we started investigating the cause in the morning. Long story short, we couldn’t find the cause that day. There was nothing special in the logs of the Rook Ceph pods and the only suspicious thing in the Grafana dashboard was a spike in the average OSD operation time. We called it a day and planned to continue the investigation tomorrow. However, the same incident happened during the night. Most importantly at the same time and got resolved by itself again. We turned our attention from the Rook Ceph to the particular nodes on which the OSDs weren’t responding. We saw quite intense CPU iowait in the Grafana but just as spikes in an average OSD operation time, it looked more like a symptom than a cause. So, that day we didn’t find the root cause either and went to sleep but when we woke up there was another surprise. The same incident with the Rook Ceph and again at the same time. At least this time the OSDs on only one of the nodes weren’t responding. So we took a deeper look into the metrics of this node and spotted a gap in the Grafana graphs (there should be the first image).<br/> We didn’t recognize these gaps in previous days because unless you don’t zoom in enough it looks like a constant rise finishing with a spike (there should be the second image).Anyway, from this point we knew that Prometheus didn’t get the data from this node at the time of the Rook Ceph incident, so we looked at the /var/log/syslog and saw an outage of the interface that is used to connect the affected node to the Kubernetes cluster.<br/> 2024-12-06T04:30:06.769443+01:00 rancher-production-node-9 kernel: bnxt_en 0000:c1:00.0 enp193s0f0np0: NIC Link is Down<br/> 2024-12-06T04:30:06.796676+01:00 rancher-production-node-9 systemd-networkd[1358015]: enp193s0f0np0: Lost carrier<br/> 2024-12-06T04:30:06.805420+01:00 rancher-production-node-9 systemd-networkd[1358015]: enp193s0f0np0: DHCPv6 lease lost<br/> 2024-12-06T04:30:06.806466+01:00 rancher-production-node-9 systemd-timesyncd[1358005]: No network connectivity, watching for changes.2024-12-06T04:42:36.080426+01:00 rancher-production-node-9 kernel: bnxt_en 0000:c1:00.0 enp193s0f0np0: NIC Link is Up, 1000 Mbps full duplex, Flow control: none<br/> 2024-12-06T04:42:36.080447+01:00 rancher-production-node-9 kernel: bnxt_en 0000:c1:00.0 enp193s0f0np0: FEC autoneg off encoding: None<br/> 2024-12-06T04:42:36.081696+01:00 rancher-production-node-9 systemd-networkd[1358015]: enp193s0f0np0: Gained carrier<br/> Eventually, we found out that this was the root cause of every Rook Ceph incident we experienced for the last few days and it happened due to the Hetzner incidents.<br/> How many of you spend an unreasonable amount of time searching for the root cause of an incident in a bad place? Also, did you get tricked by Grafana graphs anytime? What are your experiences with Hetzner incidents? How do you make production systems on Hetzner more reliable? Is the tax we pay for Hetzner being a cheap cloud provider?</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yl3ztpqj3u5e1.png?width=887&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=550fc45d29781e53631fcf938529fc1cb6f3adfd\">https://preview.redd.it/yl3ztpqj3u5e1.png?width=887&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=550fc45d29781e53631fcf938529fc1cb6f3adfd</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7552soqj3u5e1.png?width=887&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0d36006c494bda861e37417e7b8037a2e8ee8e7\">https://preview.redd.it/7552soqj3u5e1.png?width=887&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0d36006c494bda861e37417e7b8037a2e8ee8e7</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/berops_com\"> /u/berops_com </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hab3i5/problems_with_rook_ceph/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hab3i5/problems_with_rook_ceph/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"Visualize and Edit Your Kubernetes YAML with Diagrams","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hahx1k/visualize_and_edit_your_kubernetes_yaml_with/","date":1733772195,"author":"/u/iamCut","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi guys, I built this tool to easily modify JSON and YAML by visualizing them into diagrams.</p> <p>Let me know what you think, I&#39;m open for feature requests and feedbacks :)</p> <p><a href=\"https://todiagram.com\">https://todiagram.com</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/iamCut\"> /u/iamCut </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hahx1k/visualize_and_edit_your_kubernetes_yaml_with/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1hahx1k/visualize_and_edit_your_kubernetes_yaml_with/\">[comments]</a></span>","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":""},{"title":"I'm attending my first ever KubeCon, any tips to share?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1haplej/im_attending_my_first_ever_kubecon_any_tips_to/","date":1733792318,"author":"/u/newred8","unread":true,"desc":"","content":"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi there,</p> <p>I&#39;ve never attended any conferences, and tomorrow is going to me my first KubeCon in Delhi India.</p> <p>Can anyone attend any talk?

Web games or pther Services that need maintainance from time to time. I was thinking Mini as a storageclass would be great but it only seems like its used as a proxy, not a full storage solution.
