The following are options that we have looked into:</p> <ul> <li>SchemaHero</li> <li>Atlas</li> </ul> <p>Atlas is our pick but I am not a fan of the freemium service as well as them changing their features down the road. SchemaHero does not support SQL files which is a big bummer which I would have gone to them in a heart-beat.</p> <p>If you are all not using K8s operators, I would like to hear what packages you have used to circumvent this process.
