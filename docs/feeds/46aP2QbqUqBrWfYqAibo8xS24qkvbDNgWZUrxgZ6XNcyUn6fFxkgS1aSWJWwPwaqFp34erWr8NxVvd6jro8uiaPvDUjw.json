Im setting up my own k8s on debian 11. Going amazing and now looking for storage solutions. I need storage for pods but some Services require i mount them also in a filebrowser so staff can edit or update data separate to the Services using the data. Web games or pther Services that need maintainance from time to time. I was thinking Mini as a storageclass would be great but it only seems like its used as a proxy, not a full storage solution. I saw longhorn is pretty nice, but would i be able to mount storage blocks from a pod running a service to another pod running a file Browser?</p> <p>Any advice would be wonderful.
