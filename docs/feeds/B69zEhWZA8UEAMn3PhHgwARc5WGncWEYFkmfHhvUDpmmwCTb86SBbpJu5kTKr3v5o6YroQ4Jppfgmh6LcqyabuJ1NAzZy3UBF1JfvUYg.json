To listen to it, please choose \"English (United Kingdom)\" audio track, by clicking on: Settings (Gear Icon), Audio Track, Choose: English (United Kingdom). So, \"English (US)\" is the fully english dubbed track, and \"English (UK)\" is the original bilingual track. For the latter, you can turn on subtitles as well. For now, this is the best I can do. I will work with the YouTube team to figure out a better solution. I tried really hard to make this conversation as accessible as possible to people who speak only English or Spanish. I'll keep trying to figure out how to do this better. Your feedback is deeply appreciated. Thank you for listening. I love you all! ‚ù§\n\n*Corrections/Clarifications in Translation:* \n- The English translation at 23:23 says \"fiscal deficit\" when it should say \"fiscal balance\". We fixed the captions, transcript, and will try to fix the audio soon üôè\n- A few times \"liberal\" is mentioned. In most of the world (except US) that means \"classical liberal\" which in US is better understood as \"libertarian\". \n\n*Switch between English & Spanish Versions:*\nThis podcast is translated and dubbed into Spanish. To switch between English & Spanish, click: Settings (Gear Icon) , Audio Track , Choose Language.\n\nThank you to ElevenLabs for their amazing help with translation & dubbing üôè'\n\n*Transcript:*\nhttps://lexfridman.com/javier-milei-transcript\n\n*CONTACT LEX:*\n*Feedback* - give feedback to Lex: https://lexfridman.com/survey\n*AMA* - submit questions, videos or call-in: https://lexfridman.com/ama\n*Hiring* - join our team: https://lexfridman.com/hiring\n*Other* - other ways to get in touch: https://lexfridman.com/contact\n\n*EPISODE LINKS:*\nJavier Milei's X: https://x.com/JMilei\nJavier Milei's Instagram: https://instagram.com/javiermilei\nJavier Milei's Facebook: https://facebook.com/JavierMileiEconomista\n\n*SPONSORS:*\nTo support this podcast, check out our sponsors & get discounts:\n*Eight Sleep:* Temp-controlled smart mattress.\nGo to https://lexfridman.com/s/eight_sleep-ep453-sb\n*NetSuite:* Business management software.\nGo to https://lexfridman.com/s/netsuite-ep453-sb\n*BetterHelp:* Online therapy and counseling.\nGo to https://lexfridman.com/s/betterhelp-ep453-sb\n*AG1:* All-in-one daily nutrition drinks.\nGo to https://lexfridman.com/s/ag1-ep453-sb\n*LMNT:* Zero-sugar electrolyte drink mix.\nGo to https://lexfridman.com/s/lmnt-ep453-sb\n\n*OUTLINE:*\n0:00 - Introduction\n3:27 - Economic freedom\n8:52 - Anarcho-capitalism\n18:45 - Presidency and reforms\n38:05 - Poverty\n44:37 - Corruption\n53:14 - Freedom\n1:07:26 - Elon Musk\n1:12:54 - DOGE\n1:14:56 - Donald Trump\n1:20:56 - US and Argentina relations\n1:28:05 - Messi vs Maradona\n1:36:58 - God\n1:39:05 - Elvis and Rolling Stones\n1:42:45 - Free market\n1:49:46 - Loyalty\n1:52:23 - Advice for young people\n1:53:49 - Hope for Argentina\n\n*PODCAST LINKS:*\n- Podcast Website: https://lexfridman.com/podcast\n- Apple Podcasts: https://apple.co/2lwqZIr\n- Spotify: https://spoti.fi/2nEwCF8\n- RSS: https://lexfridman.com/feed/podcast/\n- Podcast Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOdP_8GztsuKi9nrraNbKKp4\n- Clips Channel: https://www.youtube.com/lexclips\n\n*SOCIAL LINKS:*\n- X: https://x.com/lexfridman\n- Instagram: https://instagram.com/lexfridman\n- TikTok: https://tiktok.com/@lexfridman\n- LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/in/lexfridman\n- Facebook: https://facebook.com/lexfridman\n- Patreon: https://patreon.com/lexfridman\n- Telegram: https://t.me/lexfridman\n- Reddit: https://reddit.com/r/lexfridman","flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/8NLzc9kobDk?version=3","enclosureMime":""}]}
